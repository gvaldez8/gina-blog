    &lt;h1&gt;Case Study: A Download Offering Campaign&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;time datetime="2018-12-28"&gt;December 28, 2018&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a new esoteric topic providing numerous business opportunities and potential. However, as much as blockchain may be an emerging and continuously growing technology, it also comes with a deficit in hard data and research to prove its benefits. Seeking to plant that early seed and more closely align with my future career goals, my mentor placed me on a project for two weeks with a few of my  colleagues aiming to sell these services offered by our company. The question is: how do you sell a product that is relatively new on the market that does not have sufficient research or data to prove that it works? The project was broken down into two major parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first half&lt;/strong&gt; included icon design, a field guide, a style guide, and an email banner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second half&lt;/strong&gt; involved some custom coding on the company's CRM system, HubSpot, for two different landing pages: a download page and a thank you (for downloading) page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My Role(s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
Design apprentice seeking to exercise skills in and/or related to art direction by creating new assets by building from a preexisting color palette and icon/illustration style set by the project's art director and illustrator.

&lt;h2&gt;Project Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul class="blogpost--ul"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To promote some downloadable content for blockchain that will generate leads in support of a download offering campaign&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To gain more impressions and just reach the audience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To inform readers and reset expectations about what blockchain is, how it could benefit their business, and why our company is qualified to do the job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To maintain my company's brand reputation for professionalism and quality through productive partnerships and technical delivery that is both durable and extensible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, you can check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHMkSHSC3rZDXs3pYAMnlG3fZBc1Ex2fEnl1lKWSxrk/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;full creative brief here for this project.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Phase I: Define&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per usual when establishing the brief, it starts with having conversations and understanding the purpose behind the project, what different team members and stakeholders think they know or understand, what's already completed, and what the team's progress is within the overall project. A majority of my first week was dedicated to having conversations with different team members: our copywriter and our marketer/content creator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing the brief helped to create that space for having necessary conversations more frequently and openly, especially between team members working on other projects, tasks, and clients. I was surprised to learn that there was a discrepancy in different team members' understanding of the topic, which also helped me to gain a better understanding of the topic myself. Our marketer/content creator felt that cryptocurrencies and blockchain were antagonistic, whereas the copywriter felt that they were interrelated because cryptocurrencies gave rise to blockchain. The brief even helped speed up the process by helping to define what icons to design, whether those icons would be repurposed, and approximately how many icons were needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to design icons for the following concepts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="blogpost--ul"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What blockchain actually is and how it actually works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The current state of blockchain in the technology hype cycle, and what that means for business leaders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Real-world applications that are showing the path forward&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strategies for positioning your organization for success in the blockchain landscape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Phase II: Research and Ideate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having about 6 meetings total within the first week, most of which were with the team copywriter and the team art director (my other mentor), I started in the research and ideation phase, quickly switching between sketching on good ol' paper and pencil while browsing Google search results for the expected, most predictable icon depictions of keywords related to blockchain like "business," "business leader," "cycle," etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/IMG_9670.jpg" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I was satisfied, or had sketched all that I could think of at least, I translated my ideas and sketches into Adobe Illustrator. And guess what? They were &lt;strong&gt;hideous&lt;/strong&gt; (screenshots below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/blockchain_sketches.png" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial ideas are never going to be perfect, which is why I reached out to my mentor for feedback. Her suggestion was to also search a popular icon site called &lt;a href="http://thenounproject.com"&gt;The Noun Project&lt;/a&gt; to conduct deeper visual research of what was already out there. Taking her feedback, I searched for other possible, less predictable, maybe even unconventional and unexpected ways of portraying common keywords like "business leader" in a variety of different styles and line treatments. I took screenshots of what I found for reference, returned to my Illustrator file, and uploaded my horrific curation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I continued to tailor, altering line widths to match a preexisting style set forth by my mentor, I would constantly be thinking about what design elements were possible to change: variating line styles from dashed to dotted to altering line gaps and even the sizes of arrows at the end of the lines. It's important to move fast and just get your ideas out there, so I tried my best to switch constantly if I found myself getting stuck and took a look at my references to see if I could combine multiple icon ideas into a single concept to create a refreshing twist, something entirely unique, something less predictable, or to even just see if I could mimic an icon in the style of our own pre-established icons as limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Phase III: Refine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/blockchain_sketches_refine.png" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once I reached a good stopping point and covered enough ground with the icon designs, I reached out to colleagues for feedback. One of them was previously a designer and is now a full-time developer at my company, whereas the other was our copywriter for the project. During this phase, I made it a point to leave my designer ego at the door because it's important to take into account that creatives make things for a vast majority of audiences, many of whom are not creative professionals themselves. Although there are some comments that are taken with a grain of salt, it's important to remember that feedback is valuable and non-designers can have unique perspectives and ways of thinking to offer that can help further refine or make something more understandable to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Both parties offered great feedback. The individual with a background in design helped to make some simpler, more minor detailed suggestions, such as altering the spacing between elements, line thickness, color distribution, and even the intensity of the line curves. The non-designer brought some clarification as to whether the ideas were in the right direction, especially when it came to reflecting more abstract concepts such as the "real-world applications of blockchain that are showing the path forward."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Phase IV: Develop and Revise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/blockchain_final_icons.png" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had fully developed the icons, the next step was choosing which ones to move forward with and show to my mentor for feedback and approval. My colleague with a design background provided me with more feedback and helped me narrow down my choices to select the ones that best communicated the concepts in a clear, concise manner. For presentation purposes and to avoid confusion, I separated the strongest ones into a multi-page PDF with their prompts in small text, dedicating a page to each icon to give the user some time to absorb what they've seen. I showed the options to my mentor, which she loved for the most part and provided some minor revisions, such as line width and curves. One suggestion was focused on the curves of the flag itself (screenshots below from left to right, the right is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/blockchain_flag_iteration.png" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Phase V: Deliver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the icons were ready, I showed the final versions to our copywriter and marketer/content creator for approval, as well as cleared up any misconceptions (i.e. the dollar sign in the flag communicating as "leaning more towards cryptocurrency than blockchain" as opposed to business opportunity). I then started to incorporate these icons into the field guide, where the team realized that we needed a few more custom icons designed. After all, it's rare when the design process works out perfectly and you don't have to go back, repeat, and iterate upon previous steps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of time, I quickly tried to see if we could repurpose any icons previously designed by my mentor and looked for opportunities to build something new without reinventing the wheel every time. Although we made progress on the field guide, progress slowly reached another plateau as our copywriter was blocked from the missing feedback from our research expert who was shifted away on client work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/images/blockchain_field_guide.png" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/blockchain_wireframes.png" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The rest of the project for the duration I was placed on it involved a lot of jumping around between steps. I repeated phases 2–5 (ideating, refining, developing, revising, and delivering) for the email banner and wireframes in replace of working in HubSpot because I couldn't get the support that I needed to navigate the company's CRM system. I also created a very rough layout of the style guide, which will more than likely change because the whole blockchain project is still under completion. In the end, my mentor was satisfied with what I had accomplished in the timeframe that I was given and I'm really happy to have been placed on a project that directly aligns with my future career goals!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;Understanding the Design Process&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;time datetime="2018-12-28"&gt;December 28, 2018&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What they never tell you in design school is that part of being a good creative is having strong skills in communication, interpersonal relationships, and writing. Ew, business-y stuff. Yes, the rumors are true and as much as the thought of human contact makes you cringe, even as a creative you will have to work with and deal with a variety of people, personalities, and working methods.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The main purpose of design is to sell. It's no secret that having strong business skills is just as important. Aesthetics matter but can quickly become disposable if the product fails to target the right audience and meet business needs. What good is the work if it's beautiful but not functional and useful? The same applies vice versa. Good design does both, so that the final product can sell itself even when the ones who made it are not there to pitch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Design Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, it looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Define&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ideate&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Refine&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Develop&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Execute&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Revise&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Deliver&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Define&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every project should start with a creative brief. You can think of the brief as an invisible contract, an outline, or an agreement between clients and creatives (no signatures required though). The brief helps to create more organization and universal understanding of client business goals and needs across different teams internally. This is especially helpful when your team members may be juggling between a variety of other clients with their teams, tasks, and projects. The end product is only as strong as the creative brief established from the beginning. The methods that internal teams use to execute on the client's business goals aren't as important, so long as it's through ethical means and every method is done with intention relating back to the brief. It's your new bible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="helper-space-top-small"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brief Basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Overview / History —&lt;/strong&gt; Before you can design anything, you need to understand the who, what, where, when, and why.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Audience — &lt;/strong&gt;Who are they speaking to?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitors — &lt;/strong&gt;Who are their primary and secondary competitors?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective / Goals — &lt;/strong&gt;What are your client's business goals? This can be as specific as increasing engagement by x% in the next 4 months to as vague as wanting to expand in the next 3 years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Message — &lt;/strong&gt;What are they trying to communicate to their audience? What do they want the audience to do?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges — &lt;/strong&gt;What pain points does your audience face that prevents them from being a user?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling Points — &lt;/strong&gt;What are you promising your audience?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Points — &lt;/strong&gt; What facts are you going to use to defend each of your selling points?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channels — &lt;/strong&gt;Through what mediums will  your users interact with your work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tagline or Theme — &lt;/strong&gt;Taglines are usually 5–7 words. There are exceptions that come with brand recognition, such as Nike's classic mantra, &lt;em&gt;Just Do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliverables and Deadlines —&lt;/strong&gt; List what you are expected to deliver and when. If there's ever a dispute as to what is expected, the brief sets the tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For branding, there's an additional step that follows the brief, which is a set of questions that you could call The Discovery Phase. Although similar to the brief, these questions do feature more depth and a set of unique ones, such as asking the client to provide examples of brands in the world that they hate or aspire to emulate with reasons behind their choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important questions from the discovery phase is what words the client uses to describe the business, which should be in no more than 3–5 words. It's quality over quantity and it's imperative to the rest of the design process to ask each of the stakeholders individually what those words mean to them and why they chose them specifically. The goal is to understand what the client is asking for and if their asks align with what they actually need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Innovative" to a designer might be translating that word into vibrant colors to express assertiveness, confidence in who you are enough to be emboldened to show it. On the other hand, "innovative" could mean activism to one stakeholder and groundbreaking to another or even just relating back to their existing product in some way, where bright colors might not even be suitable in the first place. Is the audience they seek to target their current one, a group that they hope to reach, or are they striving to connect with both, which means the creative team is playing a balancing act?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all details that are important to know in order to prevent the worse case scenario: wasted time and executed work that does not actually meet the business goals, does not successfully create brand or product differentiation in the market unique to their competitors, and establishes little to no emotional connection with their audience to drive brand loyalty. Ultimately, an unhappy team and a deeply unsatisfied client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good design always starts with research. You can tackle research in a set of different ways, but always start with their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Brand Audit —&lt;/strong&gt;Look into competitors and how they express their brand across different mediums, applications, and platforms to tell their story. Take notes and screenshots of their website or app, animations, social accounts, color palette, typography, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research the Existing Market —&lt;/strong&gt;Find out what's out there and take notes or screenshots. What's the most predictable or common thing that seems to appear everywhere? Similar to how you can't write about a topic you know nothing about, you can't design anything unique and tailor the experience to reach a specific audience if you don't know what's already out there.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn more about the Product, Service, or Business—&lt;/strong&gt;You can't design effectively if you don't know what it looks like, what it does, how it works, and how current users feel about it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a list of keywords or phrases—&lt;/strong&gt;I find this particularly helpful for just getting your ideas somewhere on paper that can be developed into tag lines, icons, themes, or even just considering the first set of keywords that your user could type into a search box and how your company can use SEO to their advantage. Starting to think about all the possible directions that you can take is a great place to start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ideate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every creative's favorite part. After the hard research comes the more visual research. Start with mood boards, an abstract collection of inspiration imagery that reflects what a brand could look like by featuring possible color palettes, patterns, typography, design elements, and photography styles that communicate a personality and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Age might be the new black, but inspiration takes many forms, some of which you can only experience beyond the screen. The world is your oyster, so think big and don't limit yourself. Consider looking at fabrics, textures, magazines, papers, objects, and just looking at things that inspire you. After you've garnered a fair amount of inspiration, it's time to sift through them. Ideally, you should aim to tailor down to about 9–12 concise images that reflect the lifestyle that the brand is trying to sell to their target audience. If you cannot explain or defend your reasons for choosing an image and how it relates back to the brand or the target audience, it's a clear sign that it shouldn't be on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For mood boards, the traditional standard is to create 3 mood boards with varying looks and feels to present to your client. Sometimes it helps to give them descriptive names similar to how you would give names for personas. Often times, the client might like a combination of elements from different boards and may request to combine them somehow, which is perfectly fine because you get closer to understanding what styles they love or hate. It's either they choose a combination of smaller elements from the boards, or ideally, select one board to move forward with because "I want everything" is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Refine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the phase where you start getting your hands dirty, sketching rough compositions, and using your mood boards and screenshots as the source of inspiration in how you might think about applying styles throughout. You may find yourself researching during this phase as well because depending on the deliverable (i.e. a brochure), as you may need additional help thinking outside the box, pushing beyond the expected, and finding nuances that make for a great twist in showcasing the predictable in an unexpected, clever way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of thumb:&lt;/strong&gt; Your first set of ideas are almost &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; the best ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;They always say that the struggle is real and that things that are worth it never come easy. The same goes for great ideas. It's when you're struggling after having created over 20 sketches that you come up with your best ones. Embrace that struggle because it's the road less traveled and leads to more engaging, evocative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Develop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this phase, you are presenting your rough sketches and your ideas either to your colleagues or to your clients. Consider this an introduction to your first pitch. You're painting a picture of the story that you're trying to tell and explaining your rationale behind each concept as it relates to the brand and business goals. This is the phase where you start to sell your ideas, so that you can move forward with executing only the best, strongest, most interesting ones. Usually, you should have three different concepts to move forward with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback and collaboration is important, regardless of whether it be from your internal team or from the clients themselves. It's important to ask the right questions. After reading &lt;em&gt;Design is a Job&lt;/em&gt; by Mike Monteiro based on my mentor's recommendation, one of my key takeaways was that asking subjective questions like, "Do you like it?" will only get you subjective answers.It's important to ask better questions to get the answers you need, such as, &lt;strong&gt;Does this successfully meet the business goals?&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;What would make this stronger?&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;What about this isn't successfully meeting business goals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, don't underestimate the feedback that you can receive from non-designers. Although some comments can be taken with a grain of salt or are not always applicable, be respectful of other people's feedback and opinions. You'd be surprised about how feedback from non-designers can be some of the most insightful just because it comes from a fresh pair of eyes and a different perspective. Remember that although you are the designer, more often than not, the products that you create are being used by a wide variety of people - yes, that's right, including non-designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Execute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where the strong technical skills come in. Your execution is just as important as your delivery. This is the phase where you translate your rough sketches into digital compositions and start playing with color distribution, design elements, blending modes and photo effects, and consider the principles of design (repetition, contrast, emphasis, balance, scale/proportion, proximity, harmony, and rhythm/movement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Revise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once again feedback is important, whether it be from your team or your client. During this stage, you should have three nearly or fully executed concepts to present in a variety of applications to get feedback on. It's especially important during this stage to get the feedback you need because this is the last step before the final delivery, which could be in print or digital formats. It's crucial that typos are addressed, that compositions are communicating the intended message, that there is consistency reflected across all the applications through type and color usage, that design elements are not misaligned or not properly scaled to proportion, and that there are no missing, required elements such as logos of the client's sponsors or the tagline. Ensure that the applications can stand equally strong independently as they can as a collective whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deliver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Execution matters but so does your delivery. Although excellent work always speak for itself, it's still important to frame that story for your stakeholders. A good way to get your ideas together is writing down your rationale behind the concepts and pieces. You should be able to explain how the user will encounter each application, why you selected that particular one and how it ties back to the client's business goals and the larger scheme. When putting together your presentation, it's important to consider sequence, pacing, and balance. Be intentional about the work you show and the order in which you show it: too much and the audience is overwhelmed with content to process, whereas too little and the audience is deprived of the context needed to understand and fully engage with the work. Well, there you have it, folks! Design is hard and so is being a creative. Thanks for reading my Ted Talk! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;UX Design Process: &lt;br /&gt; The Early Stages of Discovery&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;time datetime="2018-11-12"&gt;November 12, 2018&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most common way that people refer to the UX Design Process is through using the &lt;em&gt;Double Diamond Design
      Process&lt;/em&gt;. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src="/images/Double_Diamond_Design_Process.png" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;or here's another great, very detailed diagram of the Double Diamond Process from &lt;a href="https://blog.marvelapp.com/apply-design-thinking-hcd-ux-creative-process-scratch/"&gt;Marvel
      App&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img class="helper-space-top" src="/images/Double_Diamond.png" height="95%" width="95%" /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s some further explanation on how this works, some of which are from &lt;em&gt;The User Experience Team of One&lt;/em&gt;
    by Leah Buley.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;h2&gt;Discover&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the most important phase, as it’s the kick-off to any project that you start and will determine the tone
    for the entire process from start to finish. This phase requires extensive planning and research. This process can
    be broken up into the following segments: The Research Plan, Methods for Research, Conducting the User
    Research,Synthesizing your Findings, Defining the Problem, and Determining the Solution that will define your
    next steps and deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESEARCH PLAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note that this is different than a &lt;strong&gt;Project Plan&lt;/strong&gt;, which lays out a general overview of the project
    timeline from start to finish usually done in weekly increments.

    The Research Plan just determines the methods that you will take to conduct any research, define how that research
    ties with business goals, and be aware of what resources are available to you (i.e. any research conducted by the
    company or business). Before you can conduct research, you need to define what you seek to learn or what you are
    interested in learning, as well as any assumptions you might have prior. It’s important to consider aligning with
    business goals. Here are the steps that you would take and consider:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Research Goals —&lt;/strong&gt; This is similar to a Project Brief. Summarize your learning objectives
      into short statements. These goals need to speak to the business or behavioral change that you hope to create.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstorm Research Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What kind of research will you conduct? (See next section)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What tools will you use to conduct your research?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Contextual Inquiry&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Competitive Analysis&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Market Research&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Usability Testing&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;User Flows&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine who you will interview —&lt;/strong&gt; What kind of users will you select to interview? How many?
      Which individuals? Think in terms of roles if you don't have names. Aim to speak with a cross-functional team so
      that you can see the overall project or
      product from different angles.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start backwards — &lt;/strong&gt;For example, if the goal is to produce more sales on a landing page, you
      need
      to understand users’ perception
      of the landing page, why they’re going there, and in what ways the site does and doesn’t currently meet their
      needs.&lt;/li&gt;


    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define the Duration —&lt;/strong&gt; Estimate a timeframe of how long you think that each activity will
      take. So, for example, user interviews should take at least 1–2hrs on average.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define the Overall Timeline (The Project Plan) — &lt;/strong&gt;
      This is just taking note of any key milestones related to the project or firm deadlines that you need to be
      conscious of. Determining this step helps you manage your time, reduce, and change accordingly. You can also
      visualize this with existing tools and platforms, such as Gantt Chart or Monday.com&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESEARCH METHODS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These are the methods that you will consider when putting together your Research Plan. There are three
    different types of research that you could conduct:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Research — &lt;/strong&gt;These are learnings from users firsthand, such as:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Field research&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Guerrilla research&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Diary studies&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;User research and user interviews&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus groups —&lt;/strong&gt; Moderated discussion with a group of users, allow you to learn about user
        attitudes, ideas, and desires.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task Analysis —&lt;/strong&gt; Involves learning about user goals, including what users want to do on your
        website, and helps you understand the tasks
        that users will perform on your site.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Card sorting —&lt;/strong&gt; Allows users to group your site’s information. This helps
        ensure that the site structure matches the way users think.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveys —&lt;/strong&gt; This isn’t always the most helpful just because users have the tendency to use
        surveys as
        opportunities to rant. Consider this method as a last resort if there is absolutely little to no time to
        conduct
        proper, thorough research.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secondary Research — &lt;/strong&gt; These are collected third-party research conducted into the
      user population, such as:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Publicly available research&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Internal research conducted from other parts of the organization (i.e. marketing segmentation). Note that
        this will be
        amongst the most useful to UX Professionals, so this would be a great start.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personas, Mental Models, and User Stories — &lt;/strong&gt; These are documents that synthesize what you’ve
      learned about users after going through the aforementioned methods all distilled into digestible key points, such
      as:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Supporting diagrams (i.e. contextual inquiry, competitor analysis, product assessment)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability Testing —&lt;/strong&gt; Identifies user frustrations and problems with your site through
        one-on-one sessions where a
        "real-life" user performs tasks on your site.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User flows —&lt;/strong&gt; The step-by-step path taken by a user on a website or app to successfully
        complete a task or final action, such as purchasing an item.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personas —&lt;/strong&gt; The creation of a representative user based on available data and user
        interviews. Though the personal details of the persona may be fictional, the information used to create the
        user type isn't because it uses actual information based on user interviews. Sometimes referred to
        as a "proto-persona", these are intended to tell a story of how a
        product fits into users' lives.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Scenarios —&lt;/strong&gt; Provide a description of how users use a particular feature of your
        website. They provide a detailed look
        at how users interact with the site, including the steps users take to accomplish each task.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prototyping —&lt;/strong&gt; Allows the design team to explore ideas before implementing them by creating a
        mock-up of the site. A
        prototype can range from a paper mock-up to interactive html pages.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ART OF CONDUCTING USER INTERVIEWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Refer to your &lt;strong&gt;Research Plan&lt;/strong&gt; for the groups of users that you will interview and tailor your
    questions accordingly. Each interview should take on average anywhere from 1–2hrs and no shorter than 30mins
    at minimum. You can generally think of the type of users that you will interview and how that will influence your
    questions by classifying them into these two groups:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Interviewing &lt;strong&gt;existing customers&lt;/strong&gt; to understand what’s good and bad about the product.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Interviewing &lt;strong&gt;target customers&lt;/strong&gt; about how they balance work/life today, pain points, tools they
      use today, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Before you actually conduct the interviews, you want to do some prep work to ensure that your interview runs
    smoothly. The first thing that you should do, is write things down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREP WORK: USER INTERVIEW QUESTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Start with an introduction that defines who you are, what this project is for, assure the user’s honest, open
    feedback is valuable and make the user feel comfortable by making small talk before starting. You should also note
    how everything that is said is confidential and is strictly being used for research purposes before recording your
    interview. Then start writing down questions that you have. Of course, these questions will be tailored according
    to
    your
    product and your users, but here are some great ones to start:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What’s your role in the organization and how does it relate to the product?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;What are your goals and objectives in your role? What are your top priorities? How do you know if you’re
      successful? How do you measure success?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;How does your work impact customers? Who do you consider to be your primary customers? Can you describe them?
      What
      are their priorities and goals? Why do they use your products? What prevents them from using your products, if
      anything? What questions do you have about your users that you don’t currently have answers to?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Who are your competitors, and how well are you doing compared to them? What do you do well? What could be
      improved?
      What differentiates your company and your products in the market?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[If there’s a specific project underway that you’re involved in…] What are your goals for this project? What is
      your vision for how this project will improve our product? Do you see any risks or red flags?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here are some additional examples using &lt;a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/harvarduxgroup/files/ux-research-guide-sample-questions-for-user-interviews.pdf"&gt;Sarah
      Doody's Starter Questions for User Research.&lt;/a&gt; What's nice about her guide is that she separates questions into
    situational categories, so, for example: customer intro, topic specific, product opportunity, and
    product reaction questions, all of which you should always follow with "why" and "why not" to dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Define&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once you have conducted all of your interviews, review your recordings, take notes of all the answers, and start
    searching for big themes. You can start synthesizing your research by doing some affinity mapping. Here are some
    general things that you should to pay attention to while you’re undergoing that process:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Expectations that users have regarding the user experience&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Separate assumptions from working knowledge. What is absolutely true, what are hunches, and what gaps are there
      in
      your knowledge?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Problems or concerns with existing product&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Past things that have already been done but didn’t work well and why.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any follow-up questions that users might have that you could inform them about at a later date&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Who wants to actively be involved with the UX and in what ways?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SYTHESIZE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At this stage, you will be taking the insights you found from your user interviews and converting them into
    keyfindings that are easier to digest. Consider this a list of takeaways from your user interviews. For example,
    who you interviewed, which groups said what, and how many people feel the same way (i.e. 4/5 users felt this).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEVELOP A PROBLEM STATEMENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First of all, what is a problem statement? A &lt;strong&gt;problem statement&lt;/strong&gt; is basically a very concise,
    description of the issue that you're going to address, improve upon, or solve for. Below is the structure
    that it
    usually follows:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[USERS]&lt;/strong&gt; needs a way to &lt;strong&gt;[GOAL/ACTION]&lt;/strong&gt; because &lt;strong&gt;[SURPRISING INSIGHT].&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;[USER ROLE]&lt;/strong&gt; feels &lt;strong&gt;[NEGATIVE FEELING]&lt;/strong&gt; about &lt;strong&gt;[REASON]&lt;/strong&gt; needs to
    &lt;strong&gt;[STEP]&lt;/strong&gt; but faces &lt;strong&gt;[OBSTACLE].&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINE THE SOLUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Similar to a problem statement, a solution statement is a concise description of how you intend to solve your
    users' problems according to the research you collected. Solution statements can also be referred to as &lt;strong&gt;How
      Might We… (HMW)&lt;/strong&gt; statements. HMW statements summarize how we could help solve our
    users’
    problems, improve upon their experience with the product or service, or change their feelings and perception of the
    product. This is the last step before moving onto the development and delivery of your solution. Below are some
    tips that can help you generate successful HMW statements that stay within scope by
    starting from a general place:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amp up the Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW help &lt;strong&gt;[USER]&lt;/strong&gt; accomplish &lt;strong&gt;[GOAL or ACTION]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW make &lt;strong&gt;[SOLUTION]&lt;/strong&gt; the best &lt;strong&gt;[TYPE OF EXPERIENCE]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Emotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW help &lt;strong&gt;[USER]&lt;/strong&gt; accomplish &lt;strong&gt;[GOAL or ACTION]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW design &lt;strong&gt;[SOLUTION]&lt;/strong&gt; to help users with &lt;strong&gt;[NEED]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW make the user experience?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take it to an Extreme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW make &lt;strong&gt;[IDEAL SOLUTION or EXPERIENCE]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore the Opposite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW make &lt;strong&gt;[OPPOSITE OF SOLUTION]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question an Assumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW &lt;strong&gt;[ACTION]&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;[ASSUMPTION]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an Analogy from Insight or Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW make &lt;strong&gt;[SOLUTION]&lt;/strong&gt; like a/an &lt;strong&gt;[ANALOGY]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus in on an Element&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HMW amplify the &lt;strong&gt;[POSITIVE or NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE]&lt;/strong&gt; related to &lt;strong&gt;[USERS' NEED]&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="helper-space-top"&gt;How to Create User Interview Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now that you are more familiar with the early stages of the UX design process or have refreshed your memory of the
    concepts, let's talk about some general guidelines that you should follow when creating your own user interview
    questions:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUICK TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Clear the air —&lt;/strong&gt; Treat this like a normal conversation and start with introductions. Speak upon
      who you are, thank them for coming in and investing their time, and briefly explain the purpose of this research
      and how their honest, open feedback will be extremely helpful to your research. Assure them that anything said
      within the session is 100% confidential and is only recorded for research purposes. Ask them to briefly introduce
      themselves to help them get comfortable and ease into the interviewing process.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;"There's no such thing as wrong answers" —&lt;/strong&gt; At the beginning of every interview, you need to
      ensure
      that you have a pre-interview script that helps your users feel comfortable sharing. They need to
      know that that this is not a test, there are no right/wrong answers, and that these questions aren't difficult to
      answer.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Avoid leading questions —&lt;/strong&gt; These are questions that suggest or hint at the answer you want or the
      answer that you want confirmed. These questions are framed from your personal biases or assumptions towards the
      product and how you think that users feel about the product. An example would be, "Do you find this
      feature frustrating to use?" A better question woule be to keep it more general and open-ended, like, "How did
      you feel about this feature?"
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Avoid asking yes/no questions —&lt;/strong&gt; Simply put, getting a "no" answer could feel like running into a
      brick wall. Also, these type of questions don't allow users the opportunity to tell stories or details about
      their
      experience, which in turn, doesn't help you know how to fix or improve upon the product.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;If you can keep your questions to 5 max, then do it. —&lt;/strong&gt; If you can get people to talk about
      themselves the entire time using just 5 questions, then you’re successful. However, this varies. Read the next
      point!
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Come prepared —&lt;/strong&gt; Limiting yourself to only 5 questions can be hard, and sometimes
      depending on how
      complex the problem is or who you end up interviewing (they may or may not get comfortable enough to treat the
      interview as a conversation rather than a formal interview), you may need to have more than five questions. In
      that case, it's always a
      great idea to start big with 15–20 questions, tailor where necessary, and try your best to ask roughly 12
      questions &lt;em&gt;during the interview,&lt;/em&gt; so as not to overwhelm the user.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring your objectives —&lt;/strong&gt; Have a mental list of the top questions that you want to come out with
      answers to by the end of your interview.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep your questions simple —&lt;/strong&gt; Ask one question at a time. Try to separate or avoid using
      compound
      questions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on past events and experiences —&lt;/strong&gt; Don't ask questions that give you hypothetical
      answers (i.e. "How would you go about..."). You can't prove that the actions they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; take are the
      actions they
      will &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; take. Get your users to talk about past experiences instead because it's more accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be comfortable, make them feel comfortable — &lt;/strong&gt; Make small talk, be friendly, really listen,
      make them feel valued/important and
      users will feel more inclined to tell
      you everything that you will need to know.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t get too locked into a script —&lt;/strong&gt; Chances are that you interviewee will more than likely
      jump
      around and answer questions out of order. This is natural. Be sure not to ask them the questions that they
      already answered
      because that's a clear sign to them that you're not really listening.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with the most general questions —&lt;/strong&gt; Give them more opportunities to talk about their
      experiences. You can always ask more questions if you feel like they're off-topic or if you're not getting the
      information that you need.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Count to 10 before moving onto the next question —&lt;/strong&gt; The natural awkward silence will compel
      users to fill that space and tell you more.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask follow-up questions —&lt;/strong&gt; These would be questions like, "Can you tell me more about that?"
      Sometimes people feel the need to get the "okay" to continue and share more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AN EXAMPLE SCENARIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now that we are more familiar with the do's and don'ts of the type of questions that we should ask and how to ask
    them, here's a
    fictional scenario of a problem that exists in the real world to help practice creating our own interview
    questions:

    &lt;blockquote&gt;Finding the ideal roommate in a new city is not an easy feat. On top of the whole moving process and
      the lifestyle adjustments that
      come with moving to a new environment, there are so many things to consider from budget to living habits to
      preferred transporation methods. How would you design an app that helps a newcomer from an entirely different
      city
      find the ideal roomate?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMPLE QUESTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some questions that I developed for this scenario. A good way to start thinking about questions would
      be to do a little bit of research and consider thinking of your questions in terms of categories that encompass
      the experience:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3 class="helper-space-top"&gt;Experience with Roommates&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What prior experience do you have searching for a roommate?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="column"&gt;
      &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF EXPERIENCED:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
      &lt;hr /&gt;
      &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-columns"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When was the last time that you had a roommate?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How long was that lease for?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How have you found roommates in the past?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What methods or tools did you use?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What worked well?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is the most amount of people that you’ve lived with?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Tell me about a positive roommate experience.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Tell me about a time when you had a terrible roommate experience.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What would have made that situation better?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How did you communicate issues with your past roommates?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How did you handle problems with your roommate in the past?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;How did you split chores with your past roommates? Bills?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;

      &lt;h5 class="helper-space-top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF FIRST TIME:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
      &lt;hr /&gt;
      &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-columns"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Where would you start to find roommates?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What concerns do you have when searching for potential roommates?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What criteria do these roommates have to meet to be considered an option?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What expectations do you have of someone who decides to live with you?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What major pet peeves do you have when it comes to living with someone?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h3 class="helper-space-top"&gt;How to Find Roommates&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What methods do you currently use to find roommates?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How often do you use these methods during the roommate search?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What does the ideal roommate look like to you?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What thought process do you use to create a list of potential roommates?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is there anything specific that you look for when searching for roommates?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What factors determine whether someone is a suitable roommate for you?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What are the top fears that you have when it comes to rooming with someone?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;h3 class="helper-space-top"&gt;Roommate Habits&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What information would you share about yourself to help others determine if you’re a suitable roommate?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How have you communicated issues with your roommate in the past?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How did you split chores? Bills?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;How did you handle problems with your roommate in the past?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;The Path to Mastery UX Case Study&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;time datetime="2018-11-08"&gt;November 8, 2018&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;8th Light is a consulting firm specializing in custom software development. The company is most well-known for
    delivering top quality “crafters” and its Apprenticeship Program, where they teach and train aspiring software
    development professionals from various technical backgrounds. Established back in 2006, the apprenticeship
    curriculum has undergone numerous trial and errors, as well as constant revisions with little documentation on how
    the overall quality of the learning experience and the program have improved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Given its long history of evolution, my colleague and I were approached by a determined stakeholder who shared his
    own understanding and research of the problem: the apprenticeship curriculum currently exists as tribal knowledge,
    which results in inconsistent standards and anxiety amongst apprentices. Within two weeks, my colleague and I set
    out to assess our stakeholder's theory, define the problem, and come up with an appropriate solution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;section class="helper-space-top-small"&gt;
    &lt;div class="blogpost__number-circle"&gt;
      &lt;span class="blogpost__number-dot"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;h4 class="helper-space-left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY ROLES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this team of two, I served a mixture of primary and supplementary roles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I worked with my colleague to determine our strategy with timeline and deliverables.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Seeking to learn more about the UX process from my more experienced colleague, I took notes and observed
        during
        our
        user interviews.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt; I collaborated with my colleague in synthesizing our research through affinity mapping, as well as the
        development of
        our problem and HMW statements.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I also helped my colleague put together a presentation of our findings for our
        stakeholder to propose a pivot regarding our deliverables.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt; I played a part in the implementation portion of the process: wireframing, prototyping, and front-end
        development.
        Later, I pitched our final solution.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt; I worked with my colleague to put together annotations of our wireframes for future implementation on a
        Trello
        Board.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

  &lt;section class="helper-space-top-small"&gt;
    &lt;div class="blogpost__number-circle"&gt;
      &lt;span class="blogpost__number-dot"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;h4 class="helper-space-left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCOVERY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem we were approached with was similar but also very different than what we all expected. It turned out
      to be a much larger, internal problem within the company regarding documentation, lack of structure and
      communication, and uncertainty in terms of success metrics. At base level, both apprentices and mentors expected
      the other to initiate the conversation surrounding the status of the apprenticeship. Both were expecting the
      other to lead the apprenticeship learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;


  &lt;section class="helper-space-top-small"&gt;
    &lt;div class="blogpost__number-circle"&gt;
      &lt;span class="blogpost__number-dot"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;h4 class="helper-space-left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESEARCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the apprentice side, they felt anxiety, yes, but they also felt frustration in having to work under unclear
      expectations, were concerned about being “on the right pace,” and felt reluctant to reach out for help. There
      was this
      recurring theme of not wanting to “bother” anyone, which was rooted in adjusting to a new work environment and
      learning
      about what’s acceptable/unacceptable within 8th Light’s culture.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the mentor side, they felt uncertainty about understanding their apprentices’ success metrics. When is
      something considered “done,” or when is it clear that an apprentice has demonstrated mastery of a concept? Does
      this
      project really translate well to a client project? Mentors weren’t provided with resources on how to be a good
      mentor,
      where to go if you don’t have all the answers, and weren’t aware of what custom projects have been done
      previously to
      tailor the curriculum to their apprentice’s unique needs and skill sets.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, my colleague and I learned that the content of the curriculum, though helpful if it were more
      structured, is separate from the experience itself. A good structure does not guarantee a good
      learning experience, as there were issues beyond the structure that played a huge role in a successful
      apprenticeship, such as the mentor-mentee relationship building and the frequency of communication.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

  &lt;section class="helper-space-top-small"&gt;
    &lt;div class="blogpost__number-circle"&gt;
      &lt;span class="blogpost__number-dot"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;h4 class="helper-space-left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DESIGN PROCESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

  &lt;section class="helper-space-top-small"&gt;
    &lt;div class="blogpost__number-circle"&gt;
      &lt;span class="blogpost__number-dot"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;h4 class="helper-space-left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTCOME&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Although we had a change in project scope along the way, my colleague and I managed to deliver a few things to
      our
      stakeholder: information architecture and a site map, user flows, a high-fidelity clickable prototype of our
      solution,
      future planning via Trello for apprentices and crafters to implement our solution, and a coded extension of form
      design
      for 8th Light’s Brand Style Guide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;

    <title>An Explanation of Sass and How it Works</title>

    &lt;h1&gt;An Explanation of Sass and How it Works&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;time datetime="2018-10-16"&gt;OCTOBER 16, 2018&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let's get one thing straight. Although they are often confused because of their similarities, SCSS and Sass are
    &lt;strong&gt;not the same.&lt;/strong&gt; SCSS stands for &lt;em&gt;Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets&lt;/em&gt;, otherwise known as Sassy
    CSS for short. Although Sass and SCSS are similar in that they briefly give an overview of CSS Preprocessing, they
    have different technical syntaxes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;SCSS followed the development of Sass, and since it’s an extension of CSS, every valid stylesheet is a valid SCSS
    file with the same meaning. It even understands most CSS vendor-specific syntaxes. It is in support of the idea of
    &lt;strong&gt;DRY&lt;/strong&gt; (don’t repeat yourself) code as opposed to &lt;strong&gt;WET&lt;/strong&gt; code (write every time). Here
    are the key differences between the two more in-depth:&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;h2&gt;SASS&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;ul class="blogpost--ul-columns"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;SASS is a program written in Ruby—the technology or programming language that SASS is built on— that
      assembles
      CSS style sheets.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Uses indentation instead of brackets to indicate nesting of selectors&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;New lines rather than semicolons to separate properties&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Employs language extensions (i.e. variables, nested rules, and mixins)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;SCSS&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Incorporates some commonly used features:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-columns"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Import&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Variables&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Nesting&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mixins&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Operators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;SCSS Features: In-Depth Explanations on How to Use Them&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the major benefits of SCSS is that you can separate your code into more
    manageable, logical chunks. SCSS
    allows you the ability to separate your CSS according to different elements or components —buttons, lists,
    forms, colors, typography, etc.— to make them easier to work with and keep
    your stylesheets nice and &lt;strong&gt;DRY&lt;/strong&gt;. There are different file and folder structures that you can follow,
    such as &lt;a href="
      http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project"&gt;The Sass Way&lt;/a&gt; or
    following &lt;a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/"&gt;Brad
      Frost's Atomic
      Design&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project"&gt;The Sass Way&lt;/a&gt; of organizing a
    project would be by modules, partials, and anything related to vendors (third party CSS). &lt;strong&gt;Modules&lt;/strong&gt;
    would be
    anything like mixins, functions, and variables. &lt;strong&gt;Partials&lt;/strong&gt; would be things like the navigation,
    footer, buttons, typography, input fields, etc.
    Lastly, the &lt;strong&gt;vendor&lt;/strong&gt; directory would be dedicated to any third-party CSS like any prepackaged
    components, such as color pickers or JQuery UI.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="helper-space-bottom"&gt;In terms of &lt;a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/"&gt;Brad
      Frost's Atomic
      Design&lt;/a&gt;, although it's a great way to
    organize your
    elements or components, it should be noted that it creates additional complexity when it comes to using that
    methodology for organizing and developing your code. The reason behind that is because identifying and classifying atoms are
    straightforward, but determining
    which
    elements or components classify as molecules and
    organisms are where it could lead to one big, confusing, frustrating mess between you and your teammates.
    As
    far as achieving business goals with this method especially within large teams, the idea of having constant
    dicsusions to agree upon which is considered which is also quite draining and time
    consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;div class="column"&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@import&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p class="typography-p"&gt;Allows you to literally import styles from another stylesheet file into your current
      file, so you can separate your styles into logical files&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h4 class="helper-space-bottom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;code class="helper-space-bottom"&gt;// inside main.scss&lt;br /&gt;
      @import 'typography.css';&lt;br /&gt;
      @import 'header.css';&lt;br /&gt;
      @import 'footer.css';&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;div class="column"&gt;
    &lt;h4 class="helper-space-bottom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p class="typography-p"&gt;Defined with a &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; symbol, are assigned a value, and allow for global
      changes to all of your files. For example, let’s say that a client or a project calls for a different color,
      it’s
      as simple as updating the variable value and it will be applied everywhere else that you’ve used it. The
      hardest
      part is naming your variable, as you can be as general or generic as you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h4 class="helper-space-bottom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Colors&lt;br /&gt;
      $c-yellow: #fff03b;&lt;br /&gt;
      $c-yellow-dark: #ffe21d;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;// Fonts&lt;br /&gt;
      $f-serif: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nesting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Allows for better organization of your styles and limits repetition. Although this is a great feature, the
    rule
    is
    to only nest 3 child selectors, as it will aid in preventing confusion from nesting too many elements&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;div class="column"&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@mixins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Allows you to define a reusable and configurable block of CSS. Mixins are made up of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;@mixin&lt;/code&gt; directive, where you can also give them variables&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="typography-p"&gt;CSS Selectors&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;code class="helper-space-top"&gt;@mixin background-opts ($pos: center, $size: cover, $rep: no-repeat, $color:
      $c-beige) {&lt;br /&gt;
      background-position: $pos;&lt;br /&gt;
      background-size: $size;&lt;br /&gt;
      background-repeat: $rep;&lt;br /&gt;
      background-color: $color;&lt;br /&gt;
      }&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operators:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Allows you to do math.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;nav {
    height: $mobile-nav-height;
    @media (min-width:768px) {
    height: $mobile-nav-height \* 2;
    }
    }&lt;/code&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;So, how do we Sass?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Using Terminal in a new tab, ensure that you are in the right directory that &lt;strong&gt;contains&lt;/strong&gt;
      your stylesheets.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Type this in Terminal on the command line and hit "enter": &lt;code&gt;sass --watch nameofyourfile.scss:nameofyourfile.css&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This command means that we are telling Terminal to "watch" for any changes that we make to
            our
            Sass file that we want
            reflected in CSS when it gets compiled. By "compiled" we mean rendered in a language our browsers understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;@import&lt;/code&gt; feature, ensure that your Sass files are connected to &lt;strong&gt;one and only one&lt;/strong&gt;
      stylesheet. It should like something like this below:
      &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/0fa5b0e035ce4635e94195da13ded580.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once you have completed importing all of your Sass files to one base file, use the &lt;code&gt;@import&lt;/code&gt; feature again to attach that file to your main stylesheet that your site uses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;An Introduction to Form Design&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;time datetime="2018-10-12"&gt;OCTOBER 12, 2018&lt;/time&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Let's start from the beginning. Although form design looks like it could be really simple and fun—it certainly is
    and it definitely can be—it is a lot more complex than it appears at face value. Form designs contain quite a few
    smaller elements that make up a larger component. With forms, you have elements like input fields, the placeholder
    text within those input fields, labels, dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes. Additionally, you have to
    consider the
    different states for each of those elements to ensure that it's accessible:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol class="blogpost--ol-indent"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Default&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Focus&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Expanded/toggled/selected&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Disabled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now, don't even get me started about what you would have to do to create custom styles for checkboxes or radio
    buttons! For custom checkboxes, you have to ensure that the checkbox aligns with its container and that the user is
    able to select more than one option. For custom radio buttons, on the other hand, you have to worry about the
    opposite and ensure that user can &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; be able to select one option. Basically, forms are no joke
    and are definitely not something that you should underestimate!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;The Basics of Setting Up Forms&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INPUT FIELDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are three things that go into creating a basic, non-CSS styled input field. There should be a &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3c;form&amp;#x3e;&lt;/code&gt;
    tag
    as the container that holds all the information and enforces semantic HTML, the field label, and the input. The
    input
    usually contains the type, an id, the name (think of this as the purpose of that input), and the placeholder text
    that will be inside of that input field. These labels are all important, as they play into accessibility and the
    way
    that a screen-reader will translate information to those with impairments or disabilities. Take a look at the code
    below:
    &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/1615af8befcae87290f0be129f62ebbb.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DROPDOWNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Did you know that there are a certain number of options before it &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; be placed
    into a dropdown? Reference the &lt;a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drop-down-menus/"&gt;Nielsen Norman Group
      Dropdown Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, your options should be placed in a dropdown if you have 6–15 options. It
    becomes an issue when the options exceed 15 maximum, as it creates a readability and legibility issue with scanning
    between different options. In the example below, note that the reason that this code is not nested within the &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3c;form&amp;#x3e;&lt;/code&gt;
    and &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3c;fieldset&amp;#x3e;&lt;/code&gt; elements is because it's assumed that if you have a dropdown, it will more
    than
    likely
    already be within a form when you're coding.

    &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/925939b2fac79f8c3c306483b927261f.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RADIO BUTTONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a different purpose for when you would use radio buttons as opposed to checkboxes, as they are mutually
    exclusive and &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; allow the user to select one option. This means that if a user selects one of
    the options, it will automatically deselect the other option. Reference this article from
    &lt;a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/checkboxes-vs-radio-buttons/"&gt; Nielsen Norman Group on Checkboxes vs.
      Radio Buttons&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of radio buttons and checkboxes, you will find that the HTML structures are very
    similar to each other. They both start within the &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3c;form&amp;#x3e;&lt;/code&gt; tag to enforce semantic HTML.
    They
    both
    are contained in a &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3c;fieldset&amp;#x3e;&lt;/code&gt; element, which is used to group several controls and labels
    within
    a
    form.
    They both
    incorporate the use of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x3c;legend&amp;#x3e;&lt;/code&gt; tag, which represents a caption for the content of its
    parent.
    They both require an input type, a label, an id, a value, and a "for" attribute that helps identify what number
    radio button or checkbox you are on. Note that the descriptoins for the value and the label are the same because it
    describes what
    that option is. Here's an example below:
    &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/62fdc63e39ac26787e72ce52874323da.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECKBOXES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that you can select any number of options for checkboxes, you can also specify an additional
    attribute within the input type, which is checked or unchecked. By default, however, you should always have your
    checkboxes unchecked, as this has been proven through user testing. Reference this article from
    &lt;a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/checkboxes-vs-radio-buttons/"&gt; Nielsen Norman Group on Checkboxes vs.
      Radio Buttons&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at the example below:
    &lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/c3ef891b0c64af616dda3408c5fcc9f5.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="helper-space-top"&gt;An Example of Form Design&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;hr /&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For this week's blog post prompt, I decided that the purpose of this form was for the user to order a pizza.
    Honestly though, who doesn't like pizza?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;form class="form__container--personal"&gt;
    &lt;fieldset class="form__pizza--size"&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Hi there, I am &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="name" /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

        I would like to order a pizza for delivery at &lt;br /&gt;

        &lt;input type="text" id="address" name="address" placeholder="address" /&gt;by
        &lt;select id="time-select"&gt;
          &lt;option value="500"&gt;5:00pm&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;option value="530"&gt;5:30pm&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;option value="600"&gt;6:00pm&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;option value="630"&gt;6:30pm&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;option value="700"&gt;7:00pm&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;option value="730"&gt;7:30pm&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;option value="800"&gt;8:00pm&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;option value="830"&gt;8:30pm&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;/select&gt;.

        &lt;br /&gt;Feel free to give me a ring or shoot me a text at&lt;br /&gt;

        &lt;input type="text" id="phone-number" name="address" placeholder="(000) 000 0000" /&gt; when you're here.&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;

  &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;form class="form__container--order"&gt;
    &lt;fieldset class="form__pizza--size"&gt;
      &lt;legend&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;What size pizza would you like to order?&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;/legend&gt;
      &lt;hr /&gt;
      &lt;div class="radio-buttons"&gt;
        &lt;input type="radio" id="radio-one" value="small" /&gt;
        &lt;label class="radio" for="radio-one"&gt;Small&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="radio" id="radio-two" value="medium" /&gt;
        &lt;label class="radio" for="radio-two"&gt;Medium&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="radio" id="radio-three" value="large" /&gt;
        &lt;label class="radio" for="radio-three"&gt;Large&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="radio" id="radio-four" value="extra-large" /&gt;
        &lt;label class="radio" for="radio-four"&gt;Extra Large&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;

  &lt;form class="form__container--order"&gt;
    &lt;fieldset class="form__pizza--diet"&gt;
      &lt;legend&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Any dietary restrictions?&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;/legend&gt;

        &lt;input type="checkbox" id="check-four" value="none" check="checked" /&gt;
        &lt;label class="checkbox" for="check-four"&gt;None&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
