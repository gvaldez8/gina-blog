    <h1>Pairing Tour — Day 06</h1>
    <time datetime="2019-02-22">February 23, 2019</time>
  </header>

<p>Today I paired with Kevin Zolkiewicz, a designer at 8th Light who also happens to be a talented front-end developer. Kevin began our pairing day by introducing me to a merge conflict (thanks, Kevin). He and Alexa Albanese, another designer here at 8th Light, had been working on the same client for a few months now. With this client, they were working with contractors.</p>

<p>The merge conflict that he showed me was from one of the contractors on the project, Jeneve, who focused on laying out some of the foundations of the front-end development to tackle more of the back-end. Kevin explained more about the code workflow, JavaScript and token, and React. He explained how they are pulling information from the database (back-end) to produce how the website is displayed using the awesome powers and convenience of React (front-end). He walked me through the merge conflict and resolved it by keeping both of the conflicts because they were lines of code created by him and Jeneve.</p>

<p>It was interesting to see how everything that I have learned during my apprenticeship applies in real-world context. Kevin explained how sites these days are actually now fully built using JavaScript as opposed to just HTML/CSS. The similarities and overlap between those languages was interesting because some of what I saw in the JavaScript file was very similar to using tokens or mixins in Sass, however, far more advanced than I would ever have to deal with or touch as a designer. He let me try using tokens and writing in the language a little before switching back over to figuring out how he would refactor some of Jeneve's rough layout of code.</p>

<p>At this point, we split up for part of our pairing. Reason being was because the implementation wasn't too engaging since I'm not familiar with the language he's working in.  Plus, it would give Kevin an opportunity to finish up his work, so that we could pair on something else. I had suggested that I could use some of this time to catch up on writing blog posts about my pairing tours since I was three days behind in terms of writing, so it worked out! </p>

<p>After refactoring some of Jeneve's code to be more manageable, Kevin went over the basics of ITSCSS and an introduction to programming by teaching me some basic JavaScript terminology: variables (booleans and strings), loops, conditionals, functions, operators, and briefly went over arrays. He figured that it would be nice just to help me familiarize with the language.</p>
