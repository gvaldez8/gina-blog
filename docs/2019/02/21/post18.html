    <h1>Pairing Tour — Day 04</h1>
    <time datetime="2019-02-21">February 21, 2019</time>
  </header>

<p>Today I paired with Kelly Rauwerdink, a talented illustrator, designer, and art director at 8th Light. I joined her morning standup with Julia Murray, UX designer and researcher. Shortly after our morning standup, the three of us along with Chris Peak regrouped to join a meeting with our client to present usability testing research done by Julia with help from Nadia, as well as the low-fidelity wireframes she had created for the usability testing. The client responded well and seemed excited to see how these wireframes would come to life.</p>

<p>Directly following standup, Kelly and I began pairing remotely via video chat. Aside from the fact that our pairing was done remotely, what made pairing with Kelly drastically different from my other pairings was that I spent the entire day giving live feedback on color distribution, suggestions for layout, and instructing her in general Sketch app “etiquette” (i.e. the importance of naming layers, dynamic symbols, overrides, leading for the web, etc.) because she recently learned and picked up the Sketch workflow. This pairing was the closest opportunity that I have ever had to do anything art direction related in a professional environment that involved branding. It was exciting, refreshing, and challenging to direct, offer guidance, and give constructive feedback.</p>

<p>Although collaborating that closely for long periods of time can be draining, I felt as though we both needed it. For me, it was really enjoyable getting to know Kelly on a more personal level, her working processes with designing, how she interacts with clients, and practicing my communication and critiquing skills. For Kelly, I think that she shared my enjoyment in getting to know each other but also just generally getting to spend time more closely with a (future, hopefully) design team member, especially since she is remote 98% of the time due to working out of our office in Madison.</p>

<p>Together we worked on addressing some edits that the ad agency team emailed over the night prior into that morning, some of which in my opinion, were too literal. Due to the ad agency team’s understanding of what a brand style guide is and thinking that illustrations are a reflection of a “style guide,” they pushed for not using black and white anywhere in the design. The strangeness in their preference is that every brand style guide uses black and white by default because there should always be black and white versions for the logo in addition to considering the flexibility in text usage for readability and legibility purposes against colored or non-colored backgrounds.</p>

<p>Another issue was how we were managing our client’s expectations along with the brand reputation itself. The client was looking forward to seeing Julia’s wireframes come to life, whereas the design that the ad agency team pushed for Kelly to work with looked completely different, not to mention oversimplified where it did not address some of the wants/needs of the users according to the research she encountered in usability testing. Kelly had to make two designs for the homepage.</p>

<p>Regarding the brand reputation, the ad agency team was too focused on incorporating the vibrant, radiating color palette from the illustrations. Although it’s true that illustrations do and should make use of what the brand color palette is, the color palettes that illustrations use do not necessarily always consider accessibility and do not always transition smoothly for the web. Also, typically the brand style guide is established before the illustrations.</p>

<p>In my opinion, by not considering accessibility, what message would we be sending out to our client’s target audience? Aside from the fact that inaccessible websites are illegal, in a sense it communicates that those with disabilities and impairments do not matter. Additionally, in the larger scheme of our client’s goals, how does this accomplish being more diverse and inclusive?</p>

<p>Kelly and I worked together under these difficult circumstances trying to address the issues that the ad agency team had with her designs (also, trying hard not to cringe every step of the way with addressing their edits). We ended up with something we were content with, where we ended the day with an email to the ad agency team for approval.</p>
