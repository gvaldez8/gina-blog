    <h1>Pairing Tour — Day 02</h1>
    <time datetime="2019-02-19">February 19, 2019</time>
  </header>

<p>Today I paired with Julia Murray, another member of the design team at 8th Light that focuses on UX design and research. Julia had been working on a client account that was pro bono for a women-focused organization with other members of our design team, Kelly Rauwerdink <a href="/2019/02/18/post15.html">(check out Kelly's bio here)</a> and Nadia Doutcheva, a college graduate student who is currently interning at 8th Light and doing UX research. On this project, Nadia focused on making a research report on some usability testing that she and Julia had conducted the week prior. Unfortunately, Nadia was not present for my pairing tour with Julia due to attending to her coursework.</p>

<p>Our pairing began with a morning standup between me, Julia, and Kelly discussing the current status of the client account that they are on. In addition to working with the organization itself, Julia and Kelly had struggled with collaborating with a team from a major ad agency and an illustrator in trying to encourage the organization’s target audience to take action for women’s advocacy.</p>

<p>From my understanding, the illustrator had been working with the organization’s branding and tone for awhile. However, due to not having a strong design background, there were no standardized brand guidelines for logo usage, typography, color usage, etc. The illustrator is still on the account creating content but eventually plans to leave to pursue projects or work elsewhere.</p>

<p>Although working with the ad agency team sounded promising, it turned out that their team of creatives were not actually designers. They were project managers and copywriters, individuals who focused more on strategy than on visual and UI/UX design. One of the members was a previous employee at Julia and Kelly’s current client, had pursued a job at this ad agency, and was still continuing to work with this client to show support.</p>

<p>Immediately following standup, Julia debriefed me on the user research and usability testing that she and Nadia collaborated on. After her explanation, I worked on designing a presentation to better visualize the findings that she and Nadia had collected to help make it feel more branded. After completing this task, getting some feedback and iterating, I attended a design review meeting with the ad agency team. And let me just say, it did not go well..</p>

<p>We learned that the ad agency team misunderstood how branding translates into UI design. They were under the impression that a brand style guide, which is normally used for print, is equivalent to a UI design system. Although branding is where visual design and UI design meet, they are still extremely different in terms of the audiences and the medium itself with which the consumer interacts: the tangible vs. the digital.</p>

<p>Although branding can go into aspects of the digital space, it only scratches the surface in terms of accessibility and the standardization of components, modules, and patterns in UI experienced across the web. The ad agency team criticized Kelly’s work, claiming that it was equivalent to “government websites” and that it should incorporate all 6 colors from the illustrations that were made—mind you, that didn’t even account for 8 colors in total because a brand always includes black and white for text.</p>

<p>Additionally, the ad agency team didn’t seem too willing to work with our internal team, despite this being only their second meeting ever with Julia and Kelly. They were not only late to the meeting but joined the meeting more than 10 minutes late all via phone with the exception of one knowing that it was a design review to see the work Kelly had done. They also had the nerve to ask her to email the wireframe mockups over instead.</p>

<p>After this difficult meeting, I began working on a page with deeply nested information that Julia had been attempting to organize in a more digestible manner. However, since the page was a timeline of the organization’s accomplishments and the client was still working on changing copy, there was still too much information to work with. The timeline was organized by decade.</p>

<p>Aside from the information overload, the thought of incorporating 6 visually radiating colors that do not pair well together, worrying about responsive design especially for mobile development, and telling a story as requested from the stakeholder herself was a daunting process.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I managed to figure out a way to make it work while using the colors as subtler accent colors and focusing on the great historical photos that the organization had to aid in telling their story. I shared it with Julia for feedback, along with Kelly for her reference and to help inspire some elements for UI design, which made me really happy to know that I contributed something that was actually useful for my teammates!</p>
