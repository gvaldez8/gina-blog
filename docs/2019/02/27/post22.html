    <h1>Pairing Tour — Day 08</h1>

  </header>

<p>Today I continued pairing with Kelly Rauwerdink and Julia Murray to help on their client. The first half of the day was dedicated to our morning standup and tackling a new page with Kelly. This time, I was <strong>the driver</strong> and Kelly was <strong>the navigator.</strong> These terms refer to pair programming, which is common amongst software development teams. It’s when you have two team members working together on one screen or one coding program that allows for live code collaboration, such as Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p><strong>The driver</strong> refers to the person working directly on the laptop, typing and using keyboard shortcuts, while <strong>the navigator</strong> acts as guidance doing anything from directing with live feedback to quickly find answers via web search or sketch out possible solutions to experiment with that might be difficult to explain through words.</p>

<p>We worked on a <strong>Ways to Give</strong> page with a new approach: now that we had a more established visual style, we needed to identify reusable UI components. Kelly and I threw ideas at each other as far as what we could reuse or change slightly and from which pages. At first, what we were thinking did not completely work because we were still thinking of ways to break up the hierarchy of the page based off Julia’s low-fidelity wireframes. One of the problems that we were facing was that there were so many ways to give ranging from different topics: ways to donate, gift giving, and external giving through your workplace, financial institution, or even stock. Another issue that we faced was that generally speaking, there was a lot of content on the page that Julia had been working closely with the stakeholder to compromise and cut down.</p>

<p>Kelly and I talked through these problems, trying to figure out logical ways to break up these sections and reconsider where we grouped seemingly disparate pieces of sections, like tax forms or the client’s audit information. Some questions we asked ourselves: <em>Shouldn’t tax forms and the client audit information go with the different ways to donate because they were inherently related to donating? Are things like a gift acceptance policy or the donor bill of rights related to the act of donating, or are they closer related to the section where the organization provides legal proof that they are eligible and trustworthy in receiving donations?</em></p>

<p>We worked through the problem about halfway, reaching a point of headache, and a little frustration from fixating over smaller details. We decided it was a good stopping point to grab lunch, regroup, and then tackle that wireframe again. After regrouping and pairing with fresh eyes, we talked it through some more and made some progress before completely splitting up to cover more ground for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>We had a meeting with the ad agency team, which actually ended up running smoother because they had a project manager who was more accountable with note-taking and critical with her feedback. They gave Kelly edits to make, but fortunately, not as many as they did in the beginning when we were still trying to set the visual tone.</p>

<p>Following that meeting, I managed to finish the layout and create some iterations for Kelly’s review, but just as I was about to send them over, Julia came with new feedback—and with apologies because it was just bad luck that the edits happened to be for the page that Kelly and I had been slaving over for most of the day—from the client.</p>

<p>Julia explained the feedback and shared the client’s rationale for the changes, all of which made perfect sense. Fortunately, the edits actually made the page better because the content was simplified, thereby allowing sections to arrange more harmoniously and intentionally. My day ended with making those edits from the client, creating possible iterations, and sending Kelly screenshots via Slack for feedback.</p>
