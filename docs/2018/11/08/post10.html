    <h1>The Path to Mastery UX Case Study</h1>
    <time datetime="2018-11-08">November 8, 2018</time>
  </header>
  <p>8th Light is a consulting firm specializing in custom software development. The company is most well-known for
    delivering top quality “crafters” and its Apprenticeship Program, where they teach and train aspiring software
    development professionals from various technical backgrounds. Established back in 2006, the apprenticeship
    curriculum has undergone numerous trial and errors, as well as constant revisions with little documentation on how
    the overall quality of the learning experience and the program have improved.</p>

  <p>Given its long history of evolution, my colleague and I were approached by a determined stakeholder who shared his
    own understanding and research of the problem: the apprenticeship curriculum currently exists as tribal knowledge,
    which results in inconsistent standards and anxiety amongst apprentices. Within two weeks, my colleague and I set
    out to assess our stakeholder's theory, define the problem, and come up with an appropriate solution.</p>

    <p>On this team of two, I served a mixture of primary and supplementary roles:</p>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul">
      <li>I worked with my colleague to determine our strategy with timeline and deliverables.</li>

      <li>Seeking to learn more about the UX process from my more experienced colleague, I took notes and observed
        during
        our
        user interviews.</li>

      <li> I collaborated with my colleague in synthesizing our research through affinity mapping, as well as the
        development of
        our problem and HMW statements.</li>
      <li>I also helped my colleague put together a presentation of our findings for our
        stakeholder to propose a pivot regarding our deliverables.</li>

      <li> I played a part in the implementation portion of the process: wireframing, prototyping, and front-end
        development.
        Later, I pitched our final solution.</li>

      <li> I worked with my colleague to put together annotations of our wireframes for future implementation on a
        Trello
        Board.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <hr />
    <p>The problem we were approached with was similar but also very different than what we all expected. It turned out
      to be a much larger, internal problem within the company regarding documentation, lack of structure and
      communication, and uncertainty in terms of success metrics. At base level, both apprentices and mentors expected
      the other to initiate the conversation surrounding the status of the apprenticeship. Both were expecting the
      other to lead the apprenticeship learning experience.</p>

      <h4 class="helper-space-left"><strong>RESEARCH</strong></h4>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <p>On the apprentice side, they felt anxiety, yes, but they also felt frustration in having to work under unclear
      expectations, were concerned about being “on the right pace,” and felt reluctant to reach out for help. There
      was this
      recurring theme of not wanting to “bother” anyone, which was rooted in adjusting to a new work environment and
      learning
      about what’s acceptable/unacceptable within 8th Light’s culture.</p>

    <p>On the mentor side, they felt uncertainty about understanding their apprentices’ success metrics. When is
      something considered “done,” or when is it clear that an apprentice has demonstrated mastery of a concept? Does
      this
      project really translate well to a client project? Mentors weren’t provided with resources on how to be a good
      mentor,
      where to go if you don’t have all the answers, and weren’t aware of what custom projects have been done
      previously to
      tailor the curriculum to their apprentice’s unique needs and skill sets.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, my colleague and I learned that the content of the curriculum, though helpful if it were more
      structured, is separate from the experience itself. A good structure does not guarantee a good
      learning experience, as there were issues beyond the structure that played a huge role in a successful
      apprenticeship, such as the mentor-mentee relationship building and the frequency of communication.

    <hr />

    <p>Although we had a change in project scope along the way, my colleague and I managed to deliver a few things to
      our
      stakeholder: information architecture and a site map, user flows, a high-fidelity clickable prototype of our
      solution,
      future planning via Trello for apprentices and crafters to implement our solution, and a coded extension of form
      design
      for 8th Light’s Brand Style Guide.</p>
