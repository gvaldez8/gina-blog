    <h1>UX Design Process: <br /> The Early Stages of Discovery</h1>

  </header>
  <p>The most common way that people refer to the UX Design Process is through using the <em>Double Diamond Design
      Process</em>. It looks like this:</p>

  <img src="/images/Double_Diamond_Design_Process.png" height="95%" width="95%" />

  <p>or here's another great, very detailed diagram of the Double Diamond Process from <a href="https://blog.marvelapp.com/apply-design-thinking-hcd-ux-creative-process-scratch/">Marvel
      App</a>:</p>

  <img class="helper-space-top" src="/images/Double_Diamond.png" height="95%" width="95%" />

  <p>Here’s some further explanation on how this works, some of which are from <em>The User Experience Team of One</em>
    by Leah Buley.</p>


  <h2>Discover</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>This is the most important phase, as it’s the kick-off to any project that you start and will determine the tone
    for the entire process from start to finish. This phase requires extensive planning and research. This process can
    be broken up into the following segments: The Research Plan, Methods for Research, Conducting the User
    Research,Synthesizing your Findings, Defining the Problem, and Determining the Solution that will define your
    next steps and deliverables.</p>


  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>RESEARCH PLAN</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <p>Note that this is different than a <strong>Project Plan</strong>, which lays out a general overview of the project
    timeline from start to finish usually done in weekly increments.

    The Research Plan just determines the methods that you will take to conduct any research, define how that research
    ties with business goals, and be aware of what resources are available to you (i.e. any research conducted by the
    company or business). Before you can conduct research, you need to define what you seek to learn or what you are
    interested in learning, as well as any assumptions you might have prior. It’s important to consider aligning with
    business goals. Here are the steps that you would take and consider:</p>

  <ol class="blogpost--ol-indent">
    <li><strong>Define Research Goals —</strong> This is similar to a Project Brief. Summarize your learning objectives
      into short statements. These goals need to speak to the business or behavioral change that you hope to create.</li>

    <li><strong>Brainstorm Research Methods</strong></li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>What kind of research will you conduct? (See next section)</li>
      <li>What tools will you use to conduct your research?</li>
      <li>Contextual Inquiry</li>
      <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
      <li>Market Research</li>
      <li>Usability Testing</li>
      <li>User Flows</li>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>Determine who you will interview —</strong> What kind of users will you select to interview? How many?
      Which individuals? Think in terms of roles if you don't have names. Aim to speak with a cross-functional team so
      that you can see the overall project or
      product from different angles.</li>
    <li><strong>Start backwards — </strong>For example, if the goal is to produce more sales on a landing page, you
      need
      to understand users’ perception
      of the landing page, why they’re going there, and in what ways the site does and doesn’t currently meet their
      needs.</li>


    <li><strong>Define the Duration —</strong> Estimate a timeframe of how long you think that each activity will
      take. So, for example, user interviews should take at least 1–2hrs on average.</li>

    <li><strong>Define the Overall Timeline (The Project Plan) — </strong>
      This is just taking note of any key milestones related to the project or firm deadlines that you need to be
      conscious of. Determining this step helps you manage your time, reduce, and change accordingly. You can also
      visualize this with existing tools and platforms, such as Gantt Chart or Monday.com</li>

  </ol>

  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>RESEARCH METHODS</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <p>These are the methods that you will consider when putting together your Research Plan. There are three
    different types of research that you could conduct:</p>
  <ol class="blogpost--ol-indent">
    <li><strong>Primary Research — </strong>These are learnings from users firsthand, such as:</li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>Field research</li>
      <li>Guerrilla research</li>
      <li>Diary studies</li>
      <li>User research and user interviews</li>
      <li><strong>Focus groups —</strong> Moderated discussion with a group of users, allow you to learn about user
        attitudes, ideas, and desires.</li>
      <li><strong>Task Analysis —</strong> Involves learning about user goals, including what users want to do on your
        website, and helps you understand the tasks
        that users will perform on your site.</li>
      <li><strong>Card sorting —</strong> Allows users to group your site’s information. This helps
        ensure that the site structure matches the way users think.</li>
      <li><strong>Surveys —</strong> This isn’t always the most helpful just because users have the tendency to use
        surveys as
        opportunities to rant. Consider this method as a last resort if there is absolutely little to no time to
        conduct
        proper, thorough research.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Secondary Research — </strong> These are collected third-party research conducted into the
      user population, such as:</li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>Publicly available research</li>
      <li>Internal research conducted from other parts of the organization (i.e. marketing segmentation). Note that
        this will be
        amongst the most useful to UX Professionals, so this would be a great start.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><strong>Personas, Mental Models, and User Stories — </strong> These are documents that synthesize what you’ve
      learned about users after going through the aforementioned methods all distilled into digestible key points, such
      as:</li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>Supporting diagrams (i.e. contextual inquiry, competitor analysis, product assessment)</li>
      <li><strong>Usability Testing —</strong> Identifies user frustrations and problems with your site through
        one-on-one sessions where a
        "real-life" user performs tasks on your site.</li>
      <li><strong>User flows —</strong> The step-by-step path taken by a user on a website or app to successfully
        complete a task or final action, such as purchasing an item.</li>
      <li><strong>Personas —</strong> The creation of a representative user based on available data and user
        interviews. Though the personal details of the persona may be fictional, the information used to create the
        user type isn't because it uses actual information based on user interviews. Sometimes referred to
        as a "proto-persona", these are intended to tell a story of how a
        product fits into users' lives.</li>
      <li><strong>User Scenarios —</strong> Provide a description of how users use a particular feature of your
        website. They provide a detailed look
        at how users interact with the site, including the steps users take to accomplish each task.</li>
      <li><strong>Prototyping —</strong> Allows the design team to explore ideas before implementing them by creating a
        mock-up of the site. A
        prototype can range from a paper mock-up to interactive html pages.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>THE ART OF CONDUCTING USER INTERVIEWS</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <p>Refer to your <strong>Research Plan</strong> for the groups of users that you will interview and tailor your
    questions accordingly. Each interview should take on average anywhere from 1–2hrs and no shorter than 30mins
    at minimum. You can generally think of the type of users that you will interview and how that will influence your
    questions by classifying them into these two groups:</p>
  <ol class="blogpost--ol-indent">
    <li>Interviewing <strong>existing customers</strong> to understand what’s good and bad about the product.</li>

    <li>Interviewing <strong>target customers</strong> about how they balance work/life today, pain points, tools they
      use today, etc.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Before you actually conduct the interviews, you want to do some prep work to ensure that your interview runs
    smoothly. The first thing that you should do, is write things down.</p>

  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>PREP WORK: USER INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <p>Start with an introduction that defines who you are, what this project is for, assure the user’s honest, open
    feedback is valuable and make the user feel comfortable by making small talk before starting. You should also note
    how everything that is said is confidential and is strictly being used for research purposes before recording your
    interview. Then start writing down questions that you have. Of course, these questions will be tailored according
    to
    your
    product and your users, but here are some great ones to start:</p>
  <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
    <li>What’s your role in the organization and how does it relate to the product?</li>
    <li>What are your goals and objectives in your role? What are your top priorities? How do you know if you’re
      successful? How do you measure success?</li>
    <li>How does your work impact customers? Who do you consider to be your primary customers? Can you describe them?
      What
      are their priorities and goals? Why do they use your products? What prevents them from using your products, if
      anything? What questions do you have about your users that you don’t currently have answers to?</li>
    <li>Who are your competitors, and how well are you doing compared to them? What do you do well? What could be
      improved?
      What differentiates your company and your products in the market?</li>
    <li>[If there’s a specific project underway that you’re involved in…] What are your goals for this project? What is
      your vision for how this project will improve our product? Do you see any risks or red flags?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here are some additional examples using <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/harvarduxgroup/files/ux-research-guide-sample-questions-for-user-interviews.pdf">Sarah
      Doody's Starter Questions for User Research.</a> What's nice about her guide is that she separates questions into
    situational categories, so, for example: customer intro, topic specific, product opportunity, and
    product reaction questions, all of which you should always follow with "why" and "why not" to dig deeper.</p>

  <h2>Define</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>Once you have conducted all of your interviews, review your recordings, take notes of all the answers, and start
    searching for big themes. You can start synthesizing your research by doing some affinity mapping. Here are some
    general things that you should to pay attention to while you’re undergoing that process:</p>
  <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
    <li>Expectations that users have regarding the user experience</li>
    <li>Separate assumptions from working knowledge. What is absolutely true, what are hunches, and what gaps are there
      in
      your knowledge?</li>
    <li>Problems or concerns with existing product</li>
    <li>Past things that have already been done but didn’t work well and why.</li>
    <li>Any follow-up questions that users might have that you could inform them about at a later date</li>
    <li>Who wants to actively be involved with the UX and in what ways?</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>SYTHESIZE</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <p>At this stage, you will be taking the insights you found from your user interviews and converting them into
    keyfindings that are easier to digest. Consider this a list of takeaways from your user interviews. For example,
    who you interviewed, which groups said what, and how many people feel the same way (i.e. 4/5 users felt this).</p>

  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>DEVELOP A PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <p>First of all, what is a problem statement? A <strong>problem statement</strong> is basically a very concise,
    description of the issue that you're going to address, improve upon, or solve for. Below is the structure
    that it
    usually follows:</p>

  <p><strong>[USERS]</strong> needs a way to <strong>[GOAL/ACTION]</strong> because <strong>[SURPRISING INSIGHT].</strong></p>

  <p>OR</p>

  <p>A <strong>[USER ROLE]</strong> feels <strong>[NEGATIVE FEELING]</strong> about <strong>[REASON]</strong> needs to
    <strong>[STEP]</strong> but faces <strong>[OBSTACLE].</strong></p>


  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>DEFINE THE SOLUTION</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <p>Similar to a problem statement, a solution statement is a concise description of how you intend to solve your
    users' problems according to the research you collected. Solution statements can also be referred to as <strong>How
      Might We… (HMW)</strong> statements. HMW statements summarize how we could help solve our
    users’
    problems, improve upon their experience with the product or service, or change their feelings and perception of the
    product. This is the last step before moving onto the development and delivery of your solution. Below are some
    tips that can help you generate successful HMW statements that stay within scope by
    starting from a general place:</p>
  <ol class="blogpost--ol-indent">
    <li><strong>Amp up the Good</strong></li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>HMW help <strong>[USER]</strong> accomplish <strong>[GOAL or ACTION]</strong>?</li>
      <li>HMW make <strong>[SOLUTION]</strong> the best <strong>[TYPE OF EXPERIENCE]</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Focus on Emotions</strong></li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>HMW help <strong>[USER]</strong> accomplish <strong>[GOAL or ACTION]</strong>?</li>
      <li>HMW design <strong>[SOLUTION]</strong> to help users with <strong>[NEED]</strong>?</li>
      <li>HMW make the user experience?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Take it to an Extreme</strong></li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>HMW make <strong>[IDEAL SOLUTION or EXPERIENCE]</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Explore the Opposite</strong></li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>HMW make <strong>[OPPOSITE OF SOLUTION]</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Question an Assumption</strong></li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>HMW <strong>[ACTION]</strong> the <strong>[ASSUMPTION]</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Create an Analogy from Insight or Context</strong></li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>HMW make <strong>[SOLUTION]</strong> like a/an <strong>[ANALOGY]</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Focus in on an Element</strong></li>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
      <li>HMW amplify the <strong>[POSITIVE or NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE]</strong> related to <strong>[USERS' NEED]</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="helper-space-top">How to Create User Interview Questions</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>Now that you are more familiar with the early stages of the UX design process or have refreshed your memory of the
    concepts, let's talk about some general guidelines that you should follow when creating your own user interview
    questions:</p>

  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>QUICK TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
    <li>
      <strong>Clear the air —</strong> Treat this like a normal conversation and start with introductions. Speak upon
      who you are, thank them for coming in and investing their time, and briefly explain the purpose of this research
      and how their honest, open feedback will be extremely helpful to your research. Assure them that anything said
      within the session is 100% confidential and is only recorded for research purposes. Ask them to briefly introduce
      themselves to help them get comfortable and ease into the interviewing process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>"There's no such thing as wrong answers" —</strong> At the beginning of every interview, you need to
      ensure
      that you have a pre-interview script that helps your users feel comfortable sharing. They need to
      know that that this is not a test, there are no right/wrong answers, and that these questions aren't difficult to
      answer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid leading questions —</strong> These are questions that suggest or hint at the answer you want or the
      answer that you want confirmed. These questions are framed from your personal biases or assumptions towards the
      product and how you think that users feel about the product. An example would be, "Do you find this
      feature frustrating to use?" A better question woule be to keep it more general and open-ended, like, "How did
      you feel about this feature?"
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid asking yes/no questions —</strong> Simply put, getting a "no" answer could feel like running into a
      brick wall. Also, these type of questions don't allow users the opportunity to tell stories or details about
      their
      experience, which in turn, doesn't help you know how to fix or improve upon the product.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>If you can keep your questions to 5 max, then do it. —</strong> If you can get people to talk about
      themselves the entire time using just 5 questions, then you’re successful. However, this varies. Read the next
      point!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Come prepared —</strong> Limiting yourself to only 5 questions can be hard, and sometimes
      depending on how
      complex the problem is or who you end up interviewing (they may or may not get comfortable enough to treat the
      interview as a conversation rather than a formal interview), you may need to have more than five questions. In
      that case, it's always a
      great idea to start big with 15–20 questions, tailor where necessary, and try your best to ask roughly 12
      questions <em>during the interview,</em> so as not to overwhelm the user.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Bring your objectives —</strong> Have a mental list of the top questions that you want to come out with
      answers to by the end of your interview.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your questions simple —</strong> Ask one question at a time. Try to separate or avoid using
      compound
      questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on past events and experiences —</strong> Don't ask questions that give you hypothetical
      answers (i.e. "How would you go about..."). You can't prove that the actions they <em>would</em> take are the
      actions they
      will <em>actually</em> take. Get your users to talk about past experiences instead because it's more accurate.</li>
    <li><strong>Be comfortable, make them feel comfortable — </strong> Make small talk, be friendly, really listen,
      make them feel valued/important and
      users will feel more inclined to tell
      you everything that you will need to know.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t get too locked into a script —</strong> Chances are that you interviewee will more than likely
      jump
      around and answer questions out of order. This is natural. Be sure not to ask them the questions that they
      already answered
      because that's a clear sign to them that you're not really listening.</li>
    <li><strong>Start with the most general questions —</strong> Give them more opportunities to talk about their
      experiences. You can always ask more questions if you feel like they're off-topic or if you're not getting the
      information that you need.</li>
    <li><strong>Count to 10 before moving onto the next question —</strong> The natural awkward silence will compel
      users to fill that space and tell you more.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask follow-up questions —</strong> These would be questions like, "Can you tell me more about that?"
      Sometimes people feel the need to get the "okay" to continue and share more.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>AN EXAMPLE SCENARIO</strong></h5>
  <hr />
  <p>Now that we are more familiar with the do's and don'ts of the type of questions that we should ask and how to ask
    them, here's a
    fictional scenario of a problem that exists in the real world to help practice creating our own interview
    questions:

    <blockquote>Finding the ideal roommate in a new city is not an easy feat. On top of the whole moving process and
      the lifestyle adjustments that
      come with moving to a new environment, there are so many things to consider from budget to living habits to
      preferred transporation methods. How would you design an app that helps a newcomer from an entirely different
      city
      find the ideal roomate?</blockquote>

    <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>SAMPLE QUESTIONS</strong></h5>
    <hr />
    <p>Here are some questions that I developed for this scenario. A good way to start thinking about questions would
      be to do a little bit of research and consider thinking of your questions in terms of categories that encompass
      the experience:</p>
    <h3 class="helper-space-top">Experience with Roommates</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>What prior experience do you have searching for a roommate?</p>

    <div class="column">
      <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>IF EXPERIENCED:</strong></h5>
      <hr />
      <ol class="blogpost--ol-columns">
        <li>When was the last time that you had a roommate?</li>
        <li>How long was that lease for?</li>
        <li>How have you found roommates in the past?</li>

        <li>Tell me about a positive roommate experience.</li>
        <li>Tell me about a time when you had a terrible roommate experience.</li>
        <li>What would have made that situation better?</li>
        <li>How did you communicate issues with your past roommates?</li>
        <li>How did you handle problems with your roommate in the past?</li>
        <li>How did you split chores with your past roommates? Bills?</li>
      </ol>

      <h5 class="helper-space-top"><strong>IF FIRST TIME:</strong></h5>
