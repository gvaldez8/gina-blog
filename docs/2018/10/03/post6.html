        <h1>Getting Responsive with Media Queries</h1>
        <time datetime="2018-10-03">OCTOBER 3, 2018</time>
    </header>
    <p>Before we deep dive into the purpose of mobile first design/development, media queries, and how to apply them,
        we need to understand what responsive web design is and its purpose.</p>

    <h3 class="helper-space-top">Responsive Web Design</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is designing online experiences that adapt to various screen sizes, platforms, and
        orientations according to user environments. For example, you might use your phone on the train as opposed to
        your desktop that you use when you're working in the office. You may use a tablet or a kindle to stream movies,
        play video games, and read e-books.Responsive web design requires the use of CSS media queries—powerful
        snippets of code that define "breakpoints"—to create flexible grids, layouts, and images that resize and
        rearrange content (media, images, text, forms) to account for various screen sizes. <strong>Breakpoints</strong>
        are the point (in pixels) in which content will resize and rearrange itself to a layout that provides the best
        experience according to a user's environment. Here's an example below of both responsive web design,
        breakpoints, and how the layouts change accordingly (from left to right: desktop, tablet, mobile):</p>


    <div class="blogposts__images">
        <img src="/images/responsive_desktop.png" height="30%" width="32%" />
        <img src="/images/responsive_tablet.png" height="2%" width="32%%" />
        <img src="/images/responsive_mobile.png" height="2%" width="32%" />
    </div>

    <h3 class="helper-space-top">Mobile First Design and Development</h3>
    <hr />


    <p>Mobile first design is when you prioritize designing for mobile before considering the designs of the other
        screen sizes, like tablet and desktop. One reason for doing so is because mobile usage as opposed to desktop
        usage has increased dramatically. Another reason that it's important is because it helps in selecting and
        providing only the most essential information. The reason behind this methodology is to account for the user's
        environment—they could be traveling or commuting, casually walking down the street, lounging around in bed, or
        even just on the couch in the comfort of their own living room—when interacting with an online experience
        through mobile. Regardless of where your user might be, their level of focus will ultimately adjust according
        to the environment. There is also less real estate on a smaller screen. Hence, the reason that the design needs
        to facilitate that online experience by providing a quick, easily accessible way to locate the information that
        they need and process it within a limited amount of time. </p>

    <p>Amongst the benefits of focusing on mobile first design is that it is more time efficient and can help to
        facilitate discussions between stakeholders, product managers, designers, and developers on what information
        needs to be emphasized and prioritized. It also helps your team understand what is possible according to the
        limitations of code. Mobile first development, on the other hand, is the actual execution of the visual design
        for mobile translated into code using CSS media queries and breakpoints.</p>



    <h3 class="helper-space-top">Media Queries</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>Media queries are a feature of CSS that enables web content (media, images, text, forms) to adapt according to
        different devices, screen sizes, and resolutions. Basically, media queries are what make responsive web design
        possible. Media queries are called upon in your stylesheets using the <code>@media</code> rule, followed by a
        breakpoint, and are nested within a specific CSS property that you want to resize or rearrange.</p>

    <p>The @media rule is followed by a (max-width) or (min-width). It looks like this:</p>

    <code>@media (max-width: breakpoint in pixels)</code><br />

    <code>@media (min-width: breakpoint in pixels)</code>

    <p>So, what's the difference? <strong>Max-width</strong> defines anything below that breakpoint, whereas <strong>min-width</strong>
        defines anything above the breakpoint. Note that it is best practice to use min-width.</p>



    <h3 class="helper-space-top">Defining Breakpoints</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>Now, let's quickly review what breakpoints are:</p>

    <blockquote>Breakpoints are the point (in pixels) in which content will resize and rearrange itself to a layout
        that provides the best experience according to a user's environment.</blockquote>

    <p>Breakpoints used to be strictly defined according to standard screen sizes: </p>
    <ul class="blogpost--ul-indent">
        <li>Mobile (usually the iPhone at 320px and 480px)</li>
        <li>Tablet (usually the iPad at 768px and 1024px)</li>
        <li>Desktop (above 1024px)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, today technology advances far too quickly with new devices and screen sizes being released into the
        market every year, so there are far too many to account for between iOS and Android.When determining suitable
        breakpoints, you should instead, think more about designing for humans and selecting those breakpoints
        intuitively according to how the content (media, images, text, forms) resizes and rearranges itself according
        to how the browser width is resized. Also, a good place to start is the aforementioned: designing and
        developing for mobile first. It is always best to start with the smallest viewport first. "Viewport" is just a
        fancy term referring to your screen size. </p>



    <h3 class="helper-space-top">Bringing It Together: Using Media Queries and Breakpoints</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>As we covered earlier, media queries are called upon using the <code>@media</code> rule, followed by the
        breakpoint (defined in pixels), and nested under the CSS property in your stylesheet that you would like to be
        resized and/or rearranged.</p>


    <ol class="blogpost--ol-indent">
        <li>However, the very first thing that you should do is open up your HTML file and insert a self-closing <code>meta</code>
            within the <code>head</code>. Here's an example below of what that might look like:
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/bfddef3b26ee2c56b74cc3fb47946204.js"></script>
        </li>

        <li>Open up your stylesheet, select a CSS property that you would like to resize and/or rearrange, and add the
            <code>@media</code> rule followed by (min-width: breakpoint in pixels). For the mobile breakpoint, a great
            place to
            start
            would be with 320px.</li>


        <li>To determine your other breakpoints, start resizing your browser width. Observe any awkward instances for
            type
            sizes, images, and layouts.</li>
        <li>Once you identify your breakpoints, plug those numbers (in pixels) into the <code>@media</code> rule like
            so:
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/2390105fa00ffc79b62553dd8bdd9bf4.js"></script>
        </li>
        <li>Congratulations! You just made a media query and made one element of your page responsive! Keep in mind
            that you will have to follow this process for every element or div that you would like to change as the
            browser resizes.
        </li>
    </ol>
