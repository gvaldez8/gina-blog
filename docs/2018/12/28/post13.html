    <h1>Case Study: A Download Offering Campaign</h1>
    <time datetime="2018-12-28">December 28, 2018</time>
  </header>

<p>Blockchain is a new esoteric topic providing numerous business opportunities and potential. However, as much as blockchain may be an emerging and continuously growing technology, it also comes with a deficit in hard data and research to prove its benefits. Seeking to plant that early seed and more closely align with my future career goals, my mentor placed me on a project for two weeks with a few of my  colleagues aiming to sell these services offered by our company. The question is: how do you sell a product that is relatively new on the market that does not have sufficient research or data to prove that it works? The project was broken down into two major parts:</p>

<p><strong>The first half</strong> included icon design, a field guide, a style guide, and an email banner.</p>
<p><strong>The second half</strong> involved some custom coding on the company's CRM system, HubSpot, for two different landing pages: a download page and a thank you (for downloading) page.</p>

<h2>My Role(s)</h2>
<hr />
Design apprentice seeking to exercise skills in and/or related to art direction by creating new assets by building from a preexisting color palette and icon/illustration style set by the project's art director and illustrator.

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<hr />
<ul class="blogpost--ul">
  <li>To promote some downloadable content for blockchain that will generate leads in support of a download offering campaign</li>
  <li>To gain more impressions and just reach the audience</li>
  <li>To inform readers and reset expectations about what blockchain is, how it could benefit their business, and why our company is qualified to do the job</li>
  <li>To maintain my company's brand reputation for professionalism and quality through productive partnerships and technical delivery that is both durable and extensible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase I: Define</h2>
<hr />
<p>As per usual when establishing the brief, it starts with having conversations and understanding the purpose behind the project, what different team members and stakeholders think they know or understand, what's already completed, and what the team's progress is within the overall project. A majority of my first week was dedicated to having conversations with different team members: our copywriter and our marketer/content creator.</p>

<p>Writing the brief helped to create that space for having necessary conversations more frequently and openly, especially between team members working on other projects, tasks, and clients. I was surprised to learn that there was a discrepancy in different team members' understanding of the topic, which also helped me to gain a better understanding of the topic myself. Our marketer/content creator felt that cryptocurrencies and blockchain were antagonistic, whereas the copywriter felt that they were interrelated because cryptocurrencies gave rise to blockchain. The brief even helped speed up the process by helping to define what icons to design, whether those icons would be repurposed, and approximately how many icons were needed.</p>

<p>I had to design icons for the following concepts:</p>
<ul class="blogpost--ul">
  <li>What blockchain actually is and how it actually works</li>
  <li>The current state of blockchain in the technology hype cycle, and what that means for business leaders</li>
  <li>Real-world applications that are showing the path forward</li>
  <li>Strategies for positioning your organization for success in the blockchain landscape</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase II: Research and Ideate</h2>
<hr />
<p>After having about 6 meetings total within the first week, most of which were with the team copywriter and the team art director (my other mentor), I started in the research and ideation phase, quickly switching between sketching on good ol' paper and pencil while browsing Google search results for the expected, most predictable icon depictions of keywords related to blockchain like "business," "business leader," "cycle," etc. </p>

<img src="/images/IMG_9670.jpg" height="95%" width="95%" />
<p>After I was satisfied, or had sketched all that I could think of at least, I translated my ideas and sketches into Adobe Illustrator. And guess what? They were <strong>hideous</strong> (screenshots below).</p>
<img src="/images/blockchain_sketches.png" height="95%" width="95%" />

<p>The initial ideas are never going to be perfect, which is why I reached out to my mentor for feedback. Her suggestion was to also search a popular icon site called <a href="http://thenounproject.com">The Noun Project</a> to conduct deeper visual research of what was already out there. Taking her feedback, I searched for other possible, less predictable, maybe even unconventional and unexpected ways of portraying common keywords like "business leader" in a variety of different styles and line treatments. I took screenshots of what I found for reference, returned to my Illustrator file, and uploaded my horrific curation.</p>

<p>As I continued to tailor, altering line widths to match a preexisting style set forth by my mentor, I would constantly be thinking about what design elements were possible to change: variating line styles from dashed to dotted to altering line gaps and even the sizes of arrows at the end of the lines. It's important to move fast and just get your ideas out there, so I tried my best to switch constantly if I found myself getting stuck and took a look at my references to see if I could combine multiple icon ideas into a single concept to create a refreshing twist, something entirely unique, something less predictable, or to even just see if I could mimic an icon in the style of our own pre-established icons as limitations.</p>

<h2>Phase III: Refine</h2>
<hr />
<img src="/images/blockchain_sketches_refine.png" height="95%" width="95%" />
  <p>Once I reached a good stopping point and covered enough ground with the icon designs, I reached out to colleagues for feedback. One of them was previously a designer and is now a full-time developer at my company, whereas the other was our copywriter for the project. During this phase, I made it a point to leave my designer ego at the door because it's important to take into account that creatives make things for a vast majority of audiences, many of whom are not creative professionals themselves. Although there are some comments that are taken with a grain of salt, it's important to remember that feedback is valuable and non-designers can have unique perspectives and ways of thinking to offer that can help further refine or make something more understandable to a wider audience.</p>
  <p>Both parties offered great feedback. The individual with a background in design helped to make some simpler, more minor detailed suggestions, such as altering the spacing between elements, line thickness, color distribution, and even the intensity of the line curves. The non-designer brought some clarification as to whether the ideas were in the right direction, especially when it came to reflecting more abstract concepts such as the "real-world applications of blockchain that are showing the path forward."</p>

<h2>Phase IV: Develop and Revise</h2>
<hr />
<img src="/images/blockchain_final_icons.png" height="95%" width="95%" />
<p>Once I had fully developed the icons, the next step was choosing which ones to move forward with and show to my mentor for feedback and approval. My colleague with a design background provided me with more feedback and helped me narrow down my choices to select the ones that best communicated the concepts in a clear, concise manner. For presentation purposes and to avoid confusion, I separated the strongest ones into a multi-page PDF with their prompts in small text, dedicating a page to each icon to give the user some time to absorb what they've seen. I showed the options to my mentor, which she loved for the most part and provided some minor revisions, such as line width and curves. One suggestion was focused on the curves of the flag itself (screenshots below from left to right, the right is).</p>

<h2>Phase V: Deliver</h2>
<hr />
<p>Once the icons were ready, I showed the final versions to our copywriter and marketer/content creator for approval, as well as cleared up any misconceptions (i.e. the dollar sign in the flag communicating as "leaning more towards cryptocurrency than blockchain" as opposed to business opportunity). I then started to incorporate these icons into the field guide, where the team realized that we needed a few more custom icons designed. After all, it's rare when the design process works out perfectly and you don't have to go back, repeat, and iterate upon previous steps!</p>

<p>For the sake of time, I quickly tried to see if we could repurpose any icons previously designed by my mentor and looked for opportunities to build something new without reinventing the wheel every time. Although we made progress on the field guide, progress slowly reached another plateau as our copywriter was blocked from the missing feedback from our research expert who was shifted away on client work. </p>

<p>The rest of the project for the duration I was placed on it involved a lot of jumping around between steps. I repeated phases 2–5 (ideating, refining, developing, revising, and delivering) for the email banner and wireframes in replace of working in HubSpot because I couldn't get the support that I needed to navigate the company's CRM system. I also created a very rough layout of the style guide, which will more than likely change because the whole blockchain project is still under completion. In the end, my mentor was satisfied with what I had accomplished in the timeframe that I was given and I'm really happy to have been placed on a project that directly aligns with my future career goals!</p>
