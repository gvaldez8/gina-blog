        <h2>An Overview of Typographic History,<br> Classifications, and Characteristics</h2>
    </header>

      <p>Typography is one of the most overlooked but essential forms for communication, readability, legibility, and accessibility. It is an especially useful tool for graphic designers, visual designers, UI/UX designers, and web designers, all of whom create, design, and produce something that plays into a user's experience or interaction with a product. There are six possible categories that typefaces can fall into: blackletter, serif, sans serif, modern, slab serif and display. Here’s the low-down:</p>

      <section class='blogpost__text--space'>
          <h2 class='typography'>Blackletter (1450)</h2>
          Otherwise known as <em> Gothic</em>, <em>Fraktur</em>, or <em>Old English</em> is the script of the Middle Ages.

      <section class='blogpost__text--space'>
          <h3> Humanist (1460s – 1470s)</h3>
            <p>Sometimes people refer to <em> Humanist </em> typefaces as <em>Venetian</em> and have strong roots in calligraphy modeled on the lighter, more open forms of the Italian humanist writers. The Humanist types were at the same time the first roman types.  Often derived largely from Roman inscriptions and early serif typefaces, Humanist typefaces usually feature the lowercase two-story “a” and “g,” both of which combined makes this type typography more legible.</p>

          <p>Old Style typefaces are sometimes referred to as <em>Garalde</em> typefaces, as they were developed in the late 15th century by Renaissance typographers. In 1501, they birthed the first italic typeface. as they demonstrate a greater refinement—to a large extent augmented by the steadily improving skills of punchcutters.</p>
