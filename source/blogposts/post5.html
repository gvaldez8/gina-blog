      <h2>An Overview of Typographic History,<br> Classifications, and Characteristics</h2>
      <time datetime="2018-11-21">SEPTEMBER 26, 2018</time>
    </header>

      <p>Typography is one of the most overlooked but essential forms for communication, readability, legibility, and
      accessibility. It is an especially useful tool for graphic designers, visual designers, UI/UX designers, and web
      designers, all of whom create, design, and produce something that plays into a user's experience or interaction
      with a product. There are six possible categories that typefaces can fall into: blackletter, serif, sans serif,
      modern, slab serif and display. Here’s the low-down:</p>

    <section class='blogpost__text--space'>
      <div class='column'>
        <h2 class='typography'>Blackletter (1450)</h2>
          
          <p>Otherwise known as <em>Gothic</em>, <em>Fraktur</em>, or <em>Old English</em> is the script of the Middle Ages. It was used in the Gutenburg Bible, one of the first books printed in Europe. These typefaces were used in early manuscript writing and are characterized by their dramatic thin and thick strokes. Sometimes in other forms they will include elaborate swirls in the serifs.</p>

            <li>Almost illegible to the modern eyes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class='typography'>Serif</h2>

          <h3>Humanist (1460s – 1470s)</h3>
            <p>Sometimes people refer to <em> Humanist </em> typefaces as <em>Venetian</em> and have strong roots in calligraphy modeled on the lighter, more open forms of the Italian humanist writers. The Humanist types were at the same time the first roman types. Often derived largely from Roman inscriptions and early serif typefaces, Humanist typefaces usually feature the lowercase two-story “a” and “g,” both of which combined makes this typeface more legible.</p>

            <h4>What makes me special:</h4>
                <li>Notably calligraphic</li>
                <li>Sloping cross-bar on the lowercase “e”</li>
                <li>Usually feature lowercase two-story "a" and "g"</li>
                <li>Relatively small x-height</li>
                <li>Low contrast between “thick” and “thin” strokes; little variation in the stroke width</li>
                <li>Dark visual tone (view the page with half-closed eyes)</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Old-Style (Late 14th – Mid 18th Century)</h3>
              <p>Old Style typefaces are sometimes referred to as <em>Garalde</em> typefaces, as they were developed in the late 14th century by Renaissance typographers. In 1401, they birthed the first italic typeface. as they demonstrate a greater refinement—to a large extent augmented by the steadily improving skills of punchcutters.</p>

                <li> Serifs on the ascenders are more wedge shaped</li>
                <li> Lowercase “e” has a horizontal cross bar</li>

        <h3>Transitional (1716 – 1728)</h3>

          <p>Transitional typefaces are something referred to as <em>Neoclassical</em> or <em>Realist</em>. This type was introduced by John Baskerville and Pierre Fournier. Baskerville happened to take an interest in printing, eventually designing his own type in order to improve upon Caslon’s work. Fournier is remembered today for introducing the point system as a way to measure typefaces.</p>

        <ul class='blogposts__ul--indent'>
          <h4>What makes me special:</h4>
            <li>Vertical or almost vertical stress in the bowls of lowercase letters: <em> b, c, d, e, g, o, p, q</em></li>
            <li> Greater contrast between thick and thin (sub-) strokes</li>
            <li>Ascenders are generally more horizontal</li>

        <h2 class='typography'> Modern or Didone (Late 18th Century)</h2>

          <p>Modern typefaces were largely influenced by competitive rivals, Firmin Didot of the Didot family’s small printing dynasty in France and Giambamtista Bodoni, both of which pushed the limits of type design. Although they are always a poor choice for large chunks of text, they are best choices for display type and large sizes like titles, which emphasize the elegance of each individual character.</p>

      <h2 class='typography'>Slab Serif or Egyptian (Early 18th Century)</h2>

          <p>Slab serifs, otherwise known as <em>Egyptians</em> were originally created for advertising, posters, and other large media. They can alternatively be called <em>Mechanicals.</em>These were the first types designed as display type. Vincent Figgins is credited with the first slab serifs, as the earliest specimens were in 1815. Slab serif typefaces typically feature abrupt serifs and are usually heavier weights.</p>

            <h3>Geometric</h3>
              <p>Geometric typefaces are the <strong>least legible/readable</strong> of all the sans serif typefaces, especially for body copy. Geometric typefaces are recommended to be set in short, larger type as opposed to longer content like body copy. This type is often described as cold and clinical, yet simple.</p>

            <h3>Humanist (20th Century)</h3>
                    
              <p>Humanist typefaces are said to be the <strong>most legible/readable</strong> of all the sans serif typefaces. Like it’s serif counterpart, the Humanist sans serif also shares the calligraphic influence, basing its strokes and shapes on forms that originate from the pen or brush. Their proportions are often derived from Roman inscriptions and early serif typefaces. The lowercase “a” and “g” are most often two-story, which makes them a more legible choice than other sans faces.</p>

                <li> Greater variation in stroke width</li>

            <h3>Grotesque or Grotesk (19th – Early 20th Century)</h3>

              <p>Grotesques have a tendency to feature awkward weigh distribution around bowls of characters and irregular curves. They usually feature an awkward “a” and “g” with squarish bowls, odd curves and angles sat the tips of strokes in the “J” and “S” and overall irregularity.</p>

              <li> Obvious stoke contrast, tending to display some variation in thickness of strokes but no calligraphic influence of logical pattern</li>
              <li> Proportional idiosyncrasies</li>
              <li> Tall x-height with a vertical axis</li>
