        <h2>Explain mobile first design AND mobile first development. Why does it matter? How do you do it?</h2>
      </header>

        <p>Both mobile first design and mobile first development focus on one aspect of responsive web design, which is the act of designing for mobile first before considering the other screen sizes like tablet and desktop. Both mobile first design and mobile first development seek to reduce any extraneous content that is not essential to users under the circumstances that they might be accessing a website or app through their phone (i.e. while driving, commuting, traveling abroad).</p>

        <p>However, mobile first design differs in that it focuses more on the visual aspects of layout design and arrangement of only the most essential content while only /considering in mind/ the limitations of code.</p>

        <p>Mobile first development, on the other hand, actually translates that visual layout design into code, reflects the limitations of code that can be experienced in real-time, and incorporates the use of CSS media queries that reflect how the viewport resizes and rearranges itself starting from mobile to desktop.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, one does not take more importance over the other, as both share the same goal through different but overlapping means of achieving it. Although pursuing mobile first ultimately leads to responsive web design, the choice and focus largely depends on the product’s traffic. If users are accessing your product through desktop more than they are through mobile, then responsive web design is the way to go. However, if they are accessing the product through mobile more than desktop, then mobile first development would be a wiser choice.</p>

        <p>Both mobile first design and development play an important role for users because in today’s world, mobile usage is continuously increasing. As reflected through Statista:</p>

        <p>According to January 2018 data, the global mobile population amounted to 3.7 billion unique users. As of February 2017, mobile devices accounted for 49.7 percent of web page views worldwide, with mobile-first markets such as Asia and Africa leading the pack.</p>
