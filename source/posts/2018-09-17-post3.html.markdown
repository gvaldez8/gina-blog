      <p>There are currently 5 CSS position values:
        <ol class='blogposts__ol'>
          <li>
            <strong>Static</strong> - This is the default value of all elements and appear in the same order as
            specified in the HTML file. The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The
            top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/7b99b8230eb3780bfa9a814b4f026ab9.js"></script>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/9da0108cd7b19539ffde6fd051b7c773.js"></script>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Relative</strong> - This element means being positioned &#8220;relative to itself&#8221;, meaning
            it moves elements around relative to where they would <em>normally appear</em> in the static flow of the
            page. This works similar to margins, except neither the surrounding elements or parent element are affected
            by the top and left values. Everything else renders as if the relative item was in its original position.
            Think of the offsets as being applied after the browser finishes laying out the page.
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/7b99b8230eb3780bfa9a814b4f026ab9.js"></script>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/c9dcba6a1d16582d3eeceac779bd5a8c.js"></script>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Fixed</strong> - Does not change when the window is scrolled. A fixed positioned element will stay
            right where it is, even when the page is being scrolled. Fixed elements donâ€™t scroll with the rest of the
            page. Similar to absolute positioning, the element is completely removed from the normal flow of the page
            and the coordinate values (i.e. top, bottom, left, and right) are relative to the entire browser window.
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/7b99b8230eb3780bfa9a814b4f026ab9.js"></script>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/3ec568c0190b71fcfe1a863ea2729d4d.js"></script>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Absolute</strong> - Similar to relative positioning, but the offset is relative to the <em>entire
              browser window</em> instead of the original position of the element. It also completely removes an
            element from the normal flow of a page.
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/7b99b8230eb3780bfa9a814b4f026ab9.js"></script>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/gvaldez8/c1cbf7283073b937098dc25647b095bf.js"></script>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Sticky</strong> - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then
            offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor),
            including table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not
            affect the position of any other elements.

        </ol>
