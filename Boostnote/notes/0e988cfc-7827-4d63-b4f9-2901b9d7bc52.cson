  CSS Transformations
  W3Câ€™s Working Draft for 2D and 3D Transformations: 
  [CSS Transforms Module Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/)
  
  _*Note:* Although 3D transformations are wonderful, 2D transformations have the most browser support like transitions_
  
  
  ## Scale Transform
  `transform: scale(1.5);`: makes the object change scale when hovered. If working with an image, keep in mind scalability with image quality. 
  
  The `(1.5)` specifies how much larger times their initial size. `transform` does not disturb the rest of the elements in the document or affect the layout around it
  
  `transform-origin`: dictates where the scaling will expand from: top, bottom, center or a percentage. Reference [CSS Transforms Module Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#transform-origin)
  
  ## Rotate, Skew, and Translate
  `translate`: moves position of an element via x and y coordinates
  
  `skew`: transforms x and y coordinates. Similar to `rotate`, also accepts negative and positive degree values
  
  `rotate`: 
  rotate counter-clockwise with `-1deg` to `-360deg`
  rotate clockwise `1deg` to `360deg`
